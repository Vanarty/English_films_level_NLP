1
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:13,178
Are you sure I can't convince you to stay?

2
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:14,805
No.

3
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,727
You were right.
It's time for me to go home.

4
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:20,899
Oh, I know,
but I never said to cut your trip short.

5
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,072
- I know you didn't.
- Then why are you going?

6
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,227
Hey, can you do me a favor?

7
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:27,503
Can you get my blow dryer?
I think it's in the bathroom.

8
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,197
Joey. Stop. Tell me what's going on.

9
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,072
- Joey.
- Hey!

10
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:33,157
I'm not letting you leave

11
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,871
till we clear the air.

12
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:36,577
You sound just like Dad.

13
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,002
No, I don't.

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,249
Yeah, you do.

15
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:40,961
Whenever we used to fight,

16
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,421
he would say we couldn't do anything else
until we made up.

17
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:45,749
I don't remember that.

18
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,212
Well...

19
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:48,585
we were kids.

20
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,303
It was a long time ago.

21
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,137
Yeah.

22
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,389
Hey.

23
00:00:58,516 --> 00:00:59,556
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,689
I really wanted this visit to be special.

25
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:04,982
It was special.

26
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,265
No, it wasn't.

27
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,486
I mean, I made it all about me.
That isn't right.

28
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,948
Look, you can't always be the caretaker.

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,200
You know?

30
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,988
Sometimes you need help.

31
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,119
I just don't get it.

32
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,714
You know, I feel like...

33
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,963
Bill just woke up one day
and decided after...

34
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:27,457
fifteen years of marriage
that we don't have anything in common.

35
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:31,013
How do you feel? Do you feel the same way?

36
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,591
I don't know.

37
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:35,677
Maybe.

38
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:41,597
It's like we talk about the kids,
and we talk about broken sprinkler heads,

39
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,603
and we talk about his work...

40
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:48,691
but we're just not connected
like we used to be, and...

41
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,988
I don't know if we'll ever get that back.

42
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,365
Look, I know Bill loves you.

43
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,953
Sometimes love isn't enough.

44
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:03,793
What can I do to help you?

45
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,247
Oh... Nothing.

46
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:11,463
Because I'm the only one who can decide
how hard I wanna fight for my marriage.

47
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,548
Okay, well...

48
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,386
why don't I come to LA?

49
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,302
Then I can help with the kids.

50
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:20,265
It'll give you and Bill a chance
to figure things out.

51
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,224
Okay?

52
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,939
That's really sweet of you.

53
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,061
I can't ask you to do that.

54
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:28,981
I can't.

55
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,438
And also...

56
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,946
I was wrong about you being here.

57
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,660
About this place.

58
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,078
I can see how good it is for you.

59
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,210
That makes me really happy.

60
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,294
Jo, let me help you.

61
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,340
Oh, gosh. That's my car. I gotta go.

62
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,844
Cancel the car.
Let me drive you to the airport.

63
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,426
- No.
- Okay? We can talk.

64
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,850
Oh... No. It's too late.

65
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:03,982
I can't cancel.

66
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,519
Also...

67
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,856
can you please apologize to Jack for me?

68
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,110
I mean, my behavior at the Mingle
was totally out of character.

69
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,155
Please...

70
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:19,698
Just let me know
if you need anything, okay?

71
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:20,992
- Okay.
- Promise?

72
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,788
Cross my heart.

73
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,084
I love you, kiddo.

74
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,212
I love you too.

75
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:45,682
Vernon?

76
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,644
I'm back here.

77
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:52,646
Fishing?

78
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,493
Well, I don't think
this will work on ducks.

79
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,488
You could try hittin' them over the head.

80
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,527
You didn't tell me you were going fishing.

81
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,992
Well, my comings and goings
are of no concern to you.

82
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,078
That's not true.

83
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,632
Do you want some company?

84
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,173
No, I do not.

85
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,973
I was headed over to Paige's.

86
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,008
You wanna come
and get something for the road?

87
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,892
I ate.

88
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,676
Isn't it a little late in the morning
to be going fishing?

89
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,433
Yeah, I would have left a lot earlier,

90
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,925
except I was on the phone
with that divorce attorney

91
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:31,557
trying to convince him not to charge me
for the meeting that you failed to attend.

92
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,476
You know,
I never said I was going to make it.

93
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,395
Okay. Spit it out.

94
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,574
You are all over the map
with this divorce stuff,

95
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:44,075
and it's making me just...
dizzy trying to follow you.

96
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,658
- Vernon.
- Don't "Vernon" me.

97
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,077
You're nuttier than a fruitcake.

98
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,127
And you know what? I'm a doctor.

99
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,629
That is an actual diagnosis.

100
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,258
Lock the door on your way out.

101
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,820
You've reached Charmaine.
Leave a message and I'll call you back.

102
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,738
Hey, it's me again.

103
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,702
I'm not sure if you're
gettin' these messages, but...

104
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:29,452
I want to talk,
so, please, can you call me back?

105
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:34,583
Hey. I, uh... I gotta run out.

106
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,418
All right.

107
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:41,715
For the record,

108
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,604
I would've knocked you all the way out.

109
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,119
You're late.

110
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,286
Wasn't sure I still had a job.

111
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,088
You know, I promised you...

112
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,839
a long time ago
that I would always have your back.

113
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,717
This ain't Iraq.

114
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,387
Doesn't matter.

115
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,350
Won't happen again, I swear.

116
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,193
And that's a promise
you actually plan to keep?

117
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,306
Yeah. I'm gonna try.

118
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,067
You know, Brady, you gotta...

119
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,784
you gotta do a little more
than just try.

120
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,159
I mean it this time.

121
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:50,914
Okay, Jack?

122
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,882
Well, you owe Mel and her sister
an apology.

123
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:04,798
Yeah, I know.

124
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:07,512
I'll do right by them.

125
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:24,943
Hey.

126
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,531
- Hey.
- Um...

127
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,067
About last night.

128
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,947
- It's fine.
- No, it's not.

129
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:35,044
I was wasted and I was a total jerk.
And I just...

130
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,415
I want to say I'm real sorry
for how I acted.

131
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,292
Thanks.

132
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,378
Is Joey around?
I'd like to apologize to her too.

133
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,013
She left this morning.

134
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:50,888
Oh. Okay. Well, um, when you talk to her,
tell her I said sorry?

135
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,721
Sure.

136
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,100
Hey.

137
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,765
- Hey.
- Can I get a coffee?

138
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,023
Yeah, of course you can.

139
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,111
So, Joey left, huh?

140
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,283
She had some stuff she had to do at home.

141
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,923
She told me to tell you
she wasn't being herself last night.

142
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,577
Oh, hey. No explanation necessary.

143
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,658
Thank you.

144
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,294
I didn't realize how much I missed her.

145
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,580
I even miss fighting with her.

146
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,083
I don't know. You two seem
to fight pretty well on the phone.

147
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,918
- You know what you need?
- Hm?

148
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,923
- One of these.
- Hm!

149
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,795
I... I picked the raspberries myself.

150
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,132
- Oh, you did?
- Mm-hm.

151
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,675
Wow.

152
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,179
How are you guys doing?

153
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,437
Blood brothers
sometimes spill a little blood.

154
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,062
- Sure.
- I don't know.

155
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:46,277
I'm startin' to wonder if
my lookin' out for him is doing any good.

156
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,451
Maybe I'm part of the problem.

157
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,239
Turning your back
on the ones you love is hard.

158
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,778
Yeah, he doesn't have anyone else
to lean on.

159
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,120
Well, he's lucky he has you.

160
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,253
- I gotta go.
- What's goin' on?

161
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,171
- My grandma needs my help.
- What happened?

162
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,850
I... I don't know. She called and said
she wasn't feeling so good,

163
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:08,376
and she needed me to go to the house.
She... she has diabetes.

164
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,474
I... I called Doc, but he's out of town.

165
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,470
It's okay. I'll go...
I'll go take a look at her.

166
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,260
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I just need your address.

167
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,595
- No, I'll take you.
- No, I can go myself. It's fine.

168
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,891
- But the house is... it's hard to find.
- Ricky, you're too upset to drive.

169
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:20,976
Why don't I take her?

170
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:23,308
You just stay here
and man the fort with Brady, yeah?

171
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,686
- Yeah. Okay.
- Yeah.

172
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:25,999
- Yeah. All right.
- Don't worry.

173
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,483
- I'll take good care of her.
- Okay.

174
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,277
- It's okay.
- Okay, thanks. Thank you.

175
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,700
Please tell me how she is.

176
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,358
- I'll... I'll give you a call.
- Okay.

177
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,450
Take care.

178
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,407
Morning, Paige.

179
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:41,996
Morning. Usual?

180
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:46,882
I didn't see Doc come by today.

181
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:50,341
Uh, impromptu fishing trip.
I don't know why he goes.

182
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,723
He never catches
anything bigger than a goldfish.

183
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,180
He probably enjoys the solitude.

184
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:59,139
Oh, not that he prefers being alone
to your company.

185
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:02,603
That's not what I meant.
You know, I don't really know him.

186
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:06,855
Good Lord, you can a dig a hole faster
than a gopher in springtime.

187
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,069
Morning, ladies.

188
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,318
Did I see Doc heading out of town?

189
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,243
Fishing.

190
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:18,621
You know, I saw him dancing mighty close
to Muriel St. Claire at the Mingle...

191
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,721
- Which was lovely, by the way.
- Yeah.

192
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,226
- The Mingle was beautiful.
- Thanks.

193
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,368
Joy said she saw them dancing
cheek to cheek.

194
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,707
Dollars to doughnuts,
that woman has her sights set

195
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,712
on becoming the next Mrs. Mullins.

196
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,134
Oh, speaking of doughnuts,
could I have a dozen, please?

197
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,213
Assorted. You pick.

198
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,720
That's an awful lot of doughnuts.

199
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,220
Well, um... we have a full house to feed.

200
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,183
Well, folks who were in town
for the Mingle have already cleared out.

201
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,144
I thought Mel was your only guest
at the moment.

202
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,353
And her sister.

203
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,386
I saw Joey leave this morning.

204
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,398
If you don't need them,

205
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,609
- I can put them back in the case.
- No, no, no.

206
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:51,399
I mean...
they're already packed up.

207
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,609
You know, I... I think it's getting late.
I'd better be running along.

208
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,195
- Thank you.
- What about your change?

209
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,780
Oh, no, no, no, no.

210
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,235
You keep it.

211
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,155
Jo Ellen turning down change.

212
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,203
That woman is up to something.

213
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,158
- Preacher.
- Hope.

214
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,917
Good work last night. The food was...

215
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,542
perfectly edible.

216
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,335
I'll take that as high praise.

217
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,710
That's your prerogative.

218
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,673
Thank you.

219
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:19,184
Uh... I will take the assortment
of, uh... the usual stuff.

220
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,141
You know, for the bar.

221
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:24,391
Okay, but you know, Jack came by and
picked your order up already this morning.

222
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,515
Yeah.

223
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,191
Um... well...

224
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,111
You know, listen, Paige. I, uh...

225
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:33,686
Truth is, I wanted to talk to you about,
you know, last night.

226
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,278
Did I do or, you know,
say something to make you uncomfortable?

227
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,948
Hey, you know... you know what? Um...

228
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,075
Never mind. You know, forget I asked.

229
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:47,956
Preacher!

230
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yeah.

231
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:56,131
What are the specials at the bar today?

232
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,049
Um...

233
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,139
Spicy duck tacos.

234
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:01,888
With your delicious dry rub?

235
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,814
Can you do me a favor
and save me a couple?

236
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:07,684
Yeah.

237
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,602
- Yeah, sure thing.
- Thanks.

238
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,662
Hey, what's goin' on with you?

239
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,207
You barely said anything
since we left the bar.

240
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,995
I hate to admit it,
but you might have been right.

241
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,418
Okay. You're gonna have to be
a little more specific.

242
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:39,677
About Charmaine.

243
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,258
What happened?

244
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,425
I'm sorry. You don't have to tell me.

245
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,115
It's... it's really none of my business.

246
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,523
She said she wants a commitment.

247
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,154
What did you tell her?

248
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,520
I didn't know what to say.

249
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,978
How did she take that?

250
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,401
She won't return my calls.

251
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,617
You know, at some point,

252
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:05,158
you're gonna have to tell her
how you really feel.

253
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,580
I just don't wanna hurt her.

254
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,668
Did you ever think that you're the one
that doesn't wanna get hurt?

255
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,920
We're here.

256
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,131
Well timed, Mr. Sheridan.

257
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,880
Well timed.

258
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,834
We really need to get in there.

259
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,871
Yeah, copy that. Come on.

260
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,418
Lydie!

261
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,759
Lydie, can you hear me?

262
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,053
- There's no reception here.
- Yeah, I see that.

263
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,306
What are you supposed to do
if there's an emergency?

264
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,139
Improvise.

265
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,395
Lydie, can you hear me?

266
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,396
- Oh, hey, Ricky...
- Ricky...

267
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,200
- Lydie.
- Lydie. Hey.

268
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,244
Hey. Hey, Lydie.

269
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,827
It's Mel. I work with Doc.

270
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,122
I'm a nurse practitioner. Can you hear me?

271
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,786
- Oh...
- Hey, there.

272
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,315
Hey, Lydie. It's okay. I'm here too.

273
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,088
- Jack.
- Yeah.

274
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,713
Jack. What? Oh...

275
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,917
Why am I on the floor? What's goin' on?

276
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,718
You might have just taken a little fall.

277
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,847
- It's okay.
- Oh, tha... thank you.

278
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,397
Aah...

279
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:00,773
Okay.

280
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,693
Can you sit up?

281
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:03,856
- Uh, yeah, sure.
- Okay.

282
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,164
Okay. There we go.

283
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,238
Yeah.

284
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,856
I need you to drink all of this. Okay?
It's sugar water.

285
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:10,829
Oh, okay.

286
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,620
It should help stabilize
your blood sugar levels.

287
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,423
Ricky told me that you're a diabetic.

288
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,790
Where's Ricky?

289
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,627
Well, he... he's at the bar.
We told him we'd take care of you.

290
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,296
It's okay.

291
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:26,841
Okay.

292
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,431
You didn't have to come all the way
out here, you know.

293
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,929
We wanted to come.
I wanted to make sure you're okay.

294
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,896
I'm fine.
I'm just a little light-headed, is all.

295
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:39,979
Yeah.

296
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,694
Um, how about we get you to the bed?

297
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,404
Here, let me take that. Wait a second.

298
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,735
- All right.
- Okay.

299
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:46,880
- Ready?
- Can you stand up?

300
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,204
- Yeah, yes. Yeah.
- One, two... three.

301
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,871
There you go. Easy.

302
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,080
Okay. I'm good.

303
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,329
I'm good. Okay, okay.

304
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,503
- All right. Take a seat.
- Mmph.

305
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,165
- You're okay.
- Okay.

306
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,248
Thank you.

307
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,340
You're welcome.
Tell you what. You know what?

308
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,668
I'm gonna go outside
and take a look at your gate,

309
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,804
and I'll leave you two ladies
to talk, yeah?

310
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,341
Okay. Sure.
I... I guess that would be all right.

311
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:09,465
You're in good hands.

312
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,391
Lydie, did you test your blood today?

313
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,891
I can't stand it.
It makes me feel like a pin cushion.

314
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,814
- Have you been taking your medications?
- I hate those shots.

315
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,403
Well, I think
your blood sugar level dipped,

316
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,639
which is why you blacked out.

317
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,272
Did Ricky put you up to this?

318
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,358
He's always worrying about me, you know.

319
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,953
Lydie, it's really important for you
to check your blood sugar

320
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,199
and to take your insulin
on a regular basis.

321
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,327
Where's your blood sugar monitor?

322
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,199
- Ah, it's over there by... by the bed.
- Okay.

323
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,867
I didn't mean for Ricky to bother anybody.

324
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,127
It's not a bother.

325
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,424
He just wants to make sure
you're taking care of yourself.

326
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:50,299
You know, you look a little like
my daughter, Elaine, Ricky's mother.

327
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,684
You know, she wanted to be a nurse.

328
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,393
Then she met Ricky's father, and...

329
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,640
I always knew he was trouble
from the moment I laid eyes on him.

330
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,809
When Ricky was born, he stuck around
for a few months, and then...

331
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,980
up and left.

332
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,992
Elaine was devastated.

333
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:14,156
They said that it was the drugs
that killed her.

334
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,945
But I know that...

335
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,156
my baby died from a broken heart.

336
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,332
And then...

337
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:27,337
Ricky came to live with me,
and it's been the two of us ever since.

338
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,221
Well, it sounds like you two are lucky
to have each other.

339
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,799
He's all I have left.

340
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,257
Okay, the gate's all fixed.

341
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,215
Oh, thank you, Jack.

342
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,642
All right,
unfortunately, it's pin cushion time.

343
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,056
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.

344
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:45,856
Are you ready?

345
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,069
I think so.

346
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,279
Okay, one, two, three.

347
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,069
Sorry.

348
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,863
Uh, you know, my husband, Herb,

349
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,120
he was the exact opposite of Ricky's dad.

350
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:00,825
He was strong and dependable.

351
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,293
Not a day goes by I don't miss him.

352
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,129
It's been ten years
since he's been gone, and...

353
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,460
and it feels like yesterday.

354
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,675
Did Herb help you manage your diabetes?

355
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,353
Oh, he was insufferable.

356
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,352
He, uh...
kept pestering me to move around.

357
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,060
Stop eating this or that.

358
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,440
Okay, well, Lydie, your blood sugar level
is still really low.

359
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,197
So, I'd like to get you checked out
at the hospital.

360
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,954
Jack can call Ricky,

361
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,512
and I'll call Grace Valley
and let them know that we're coming.

362
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:43,076
- I don't wanna go to the hospital.
- I know, but you need to be monitored.

363
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,253
Hey, Lydie, you know...

364
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,749
Would it make you feel better
if I had Ricky come meet us there?

365
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,916
Do you think going
to the hospital is necessary?

366
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:55,507
Well, I think that Herb would want you
to take care of yourself,

367
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,972
and I know that
it will make Ricky feel better too.

368
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,392
He's the only reason I keep going.

369
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,434
I miss my Herb so much.

370
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,098
Yeah.

371
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,731
It's okay.

372
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,690
I'm sorry.

373
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:13,776
It's okay.

374
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,026
I'm sorry.

375
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,529
It's okay.

376
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,578
It's okay. Thank you. Thank you.

377
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,090
Anybody else?

378
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,172
- Oh, yes, I'd love a top-up.
- Here.

379
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,047
- Thank you, Muriel.
- Oh, you're welcome.

380
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,894
- Uh-oh.
- Well...

381
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:42,928
lucky for you all,
I'm in the mood for a doughnut.

382
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,595
- Hm...
- Lilly...

383
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,440
you're looking well.

384
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,939
Thank you.
I'm feeling a little better every day.

385
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,731
Glad to hear it.
Baby Chloe needs her mama.

386
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,987
And you know what I need?
Something glazed.

387
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:58,993
Ooh!

388
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:02,412
It's been months
since we gals have gotten together.

389
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,998
Oh. Don't just sit there. Deal me in.

390
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,869
- Oh, um...
- Sorry, honey.

391
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,626
Uh, we've already got a full house.

392
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:10,788
I saw an empty chair.

393
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,877
What are we playing?

394
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:13,841
Canasta.

395
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,721
I prefer seven-card stud,
but canasta it is.

396
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,968
Hope, the truth is, we...

397
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,051
Well? Spit it out.

398
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,757
We don't wanna play with you.

399
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:26,177
- You don't want me to play cards with you?
- No.

400
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,443
Well, isn't that something?

401
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,438
You're very... competitive.

402
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:34,271
- Hm.
- So, you don't care about winning?

403
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,028
Because last time we played,
you cleaned house.

404
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,823
- It's nothing personal.
- No.

405
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,655
We're just looking
to have a friendly game.

406
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,831
I always maintain strict decorum
during leisure activities.

407
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,251
Honey, you're like a tornado
in a glass factory.

408
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,540
And your outbursts are very upsetting.

409
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,294
You've always been too sensitive.

410
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,418
- Do you think I'm too sensitive?
- Fine. I...

411
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,130
I won't yell.

412
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,972
And you promise not to badger me
if I keep winning?

413
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,301
Consider this a badger-free zone.

414
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,812
Come on, ladies. Let's give her a chance.

415
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,020
Finally! You were always my favorite.

416
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,278
Hey, shift's not over for another hour.

417
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,573
I'm gonna bounce.

418
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,450
I'm not feelin' so good.

419
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,744
Did you clean out the grease trap?

420
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,080
Yeah.

421
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,661
That's probably what made me feel sick.
Thing's disgusting.

422
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:33,917
Yeah, well, you look like
you might be more hung over than sick.

423
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,246
I don't remember asking you.

424
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,220
Why are you really here, Brady?

425
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,564
Work, just like you.

426
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,758
Oh, no.

427
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,483
No, you and I, we are...
we are nothin' alike.

428
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:54,305
Man, you're never gonna change,
are you?

429
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,322
Still think we're back in Mosul.

430
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,646
Hoo-rah!

431
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,235
I'm tryin', Preach.

432
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,299
- Just give me a break, all right?
- Hey.

433
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,331
You stole money out of the safe.
You steal tips from the wait staff.

434
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,124
I think I've cut you enough breaks.

435
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,628
You know,
you're lucky this is Jack's place.

436
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,960
Anybody else would have kicked your ass
to the curb.

437
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,632
That's what it is, isn't it?

438
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,676
You can't handle
that Jack and I are tight.

439
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,890
Huh!

440
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,061
You're not a friend.

441
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,180
You're a leech.

442
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,442
And for once, why can't you just
do the right thing, man?

443
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,942
And what's that, Preach?

444
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:43,647
Leave town.

445
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:47,661
You know, just get out of here.

446
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,078
- Go.
- I'm gone.

447
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:55,868
Hey, Preacher.

448
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:56,827
Hey.

449
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:57,917
Little man.

450
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,462
- Hi.
- Hello.

451
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,455
Our car died.

452
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,416
Oh.

453
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:05,836
Yeah. Um, I parked it out back
to make a delivery across the street.

454
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:09,206
When I got back, the car wouldn't start.
I left the door open, drained the battery.

455
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,782
Do you think you could give us a jump?

456
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,907
Oh, you know what? Never mind.

457
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,847
- You're busy.
- No, no, it's okay.

458
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,148
Uh, why don't you two grab a seat?

459
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,857
Hm? Get something warm to drink.

460
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,356
How about some hot cocoa?

461
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:27,164
- Extra marshmallows?
- As many as you can handle.

462
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,204
- Thank you, Preacher.
- Okay.

463
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:42,336
Well, they're gonna keep Lydie overnight,

464
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,166
but Ricky's gonna stay with her.

465
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,086
- Good.
- Yeah.

466
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:47,183
I'll come back and check on them tomorrow.

467
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,639
Okay. Sounds good.

468
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:53,681
You ready?

469
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,224
Mel?

470
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,230
Mel.

471
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,809
What don't you understand?

472
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:00,904
- I need to be in that room!
- I'm sorry, but you're not allowed.

473
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,151
I'm gonna be doing
his follow-up care, okay?

474
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,151
I'm... I'm sorry.

475
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,409
I know you're just doing your job.

476
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,825
But what would you do if you were me?

477
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,250
That's my husband.

478
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,586
Mel.

479
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,051
- What?
- Are you ready?

480
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,591
Ready.

481
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,087
- To go back home.
- I'm sorry. I... I have to sit down.

482
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,354
Let me get you a water.

483
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,860
You feeling any better?

484
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,331
You wanna talk about it?

485
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,209
I can't.

486
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,553
It's okay.

487
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,297
Hey, it's okay.

488
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,342
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

489
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,012
Hey, it's okay.

490
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,047
Ah, okay...

491
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,257
Ahem.

492
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,427
I'm gonna take, uh...

493
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,056
God, I can't give her that.

494
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,102
Oh.

495
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,698
Canasta. I'm out.

496
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,703
You have got to be kidding me.

497
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,905
- Now, Hope...
- Don't you "now Hope" me.

498
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:06,626
That's three hands in a row we were up,
and you came back to beat us.

499
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,248
That's just the way the game goes.

500
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,335
If you're cheating!

501
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,459
Don't be ridiculous.

502
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:14,255
Lilly knew you were collecting kings,
and she served one up on a silver platter.

503
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,011
Coincidence? I think not.

504
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:18,302
I... I... I was holding onto fours.

505
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:20,096
Well, I... I demand a rematch.

506
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,470
This is exactly why we didn't invite you.

507
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:29,556
I guess I'll save you the trouble
of asking me to leave.

508
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,190
Ladies...

509
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,782
enjoy your afternoon.

510
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,111
Hope...

511
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:37,404
We...

512
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,876
Lydie said her husband's been dead
for ten years.

513
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,924
She still misses him every day.

514
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,589
Well, there's something beautiful
about that.

515
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,506
Or very, very sad.

516
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:00,974
Well, maybe a bit of both.

517
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,894
My dad used to say that the...

518
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:07,015
price of love was loss.

519
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:12,572
There's probably some truth to that,
but I'd say most people...

520
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,775
would also say that
love is worth the risk, don't you think?

521
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,662
Honestly, I... I don't...
I don't know anymore.

522
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,080
How about a little detour?

523
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:30,248
Well, as long as it doesn't involve
hiking or baseball.

524
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:31,423
Hah!

525
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,335
Okay.

526
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:39,263
I had 16 marshmallows.

527
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:42,852
Wow. That is a new Jack's Bar record, hm?

528
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,555
I, uh... I left the car running.
You'll need to drive it around for,

529
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,561
you know, 20 minutes or so
to charge the battery.

530
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:51,401
Oh, okay. Thank you. You're a lifesaver.

531
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,939
So, you goin' on a trip?

532
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,900
Nope.

533
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,614
I mean, I could use a vacation.

534
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,841
- Why do you ask?
- Oh, it's just, I, uh...

535
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,225
you know, saw luggage in the back.

536
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,373
Oh. No, no, I'm just, um...

537
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,329
donating some old clothes,

538
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,122
and it's easier to get it
to the Goodwill in Clear River.

539
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,246
Uh-huh. Mm.

540
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:12,705
Mom.

541
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:13,882
Okay, okay.

542
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,300
- Come on.
- Okay, uh, you guys should get goin'.

543
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,459
Yeah. Uh...

544
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,552
Thank you. I owe you.

545
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:50,464
Holy cow. What are you, a pinball wizard?

546
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:53,004
Yeah, well, I, uh...

547
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:56,745
I used to hang out at this bar
when I was in college,

548
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:58,376
and they had a machine just like this.

549
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,973
- I wasted a lot of time there.
- Well, I wouldn't say wasted.

550
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,769
If the whole nursing thing
doesn't work out,

551
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,301
you could always play professionally.

552
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:05,595
No, that's not a thing.

553
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,782
- Oh, it's not a thing?
- It's not a thing.

554
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:08,676
- Really?
- No.

555
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:09,765
Okay.

556
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:11,391
Uh...

557
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,306
Let's see. The...

558
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:18,863
purpose of the PAPA circuit is
to raise awareness of competitive pinball.

559
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,879
- Oh, I'm sorry. Did I just...
- Oh, come on.

560
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,173
- Was that distracting?
- You made me lose my concentration.

561
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,777
- That's not fair.
- Oh, come on. Don't hate the player.

562
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,544
Oh, I think this game is rigged.

563
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:41,212
Uh... Okay, what?

564
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:43,127
- What?
- You distracted me.

565
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:45,836
- You happy now?
- I didn't distract nothing. I... What...

566
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,394
I'm hungry. We should get some food.

567
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:53,059
- What, are you buying?
- Well, you drove, so, yeah.

568
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,142
Come on.

569
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,110
Stop.

570
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,397
You didn't have to walk me to my door.

571
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:06,737
Oh, if you knew how I was raised,
you'd understand.

572
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:08,323
Right.

573
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,237
Well, thanks for the ride.

574
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,326
Oh, any time.

575
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:12,871
And for cheering me up.

576
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,498
I think we can give pinball
most of the credit for that.

577
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:16,582
Mm!

578
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:22,298
You know, I don't think I'd still
be here if it wasn't for you.

579
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,720
Well, I don't think that's true.

580
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,012
I do.

581
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,389
Good night.

582
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:34,725

It's funny.

I'm listening.

606
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:07,797
You said last night at the Mingle
that you loved me

607
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,589
and that you needed
to know how I felt about you.

00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:12,257
Yeah.

I don't know what you want me to say. I...

614
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,147
Jack, I want you to say
that you feel the same way about me,

615
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:35,156
that... that you're committed
in this relationship.

616
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,784
Look, Char, I... I...

617
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:42,663
care about you, deeply...

618
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,672
but I... I can't do that.

619
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,419
Why not?

620
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,129
I don't know.

621
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:52,631
Really?

622
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,933
You sure Mel doesn't have anything
to do with this?

623
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,600
This is about you and me.

Huh.

625
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,350
Yeah. I... I don't know if I believe that.

626
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,683
I'm being straight with you.

627
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:08,478
Well, I don't think
you're being honest with yourself.

628
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,463
I don't know what you want me to do.

I wouldn't expect you to.

632
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,913
You should go.

633
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:30,998
I didn't mean to hurt you.

634
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,257
You didn't. You just wasted my time.

to drag the kids out so late.
