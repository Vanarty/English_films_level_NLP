00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,646
No.

170
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:17,152
Not even when you were young?
No, not even when I was young.

171
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,947
You sure you don't want to drive with me?

172
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,825
Oh, how will I get back to Baltimore on Friday?

173
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:27,162
I forgot the present. Walter,
I left your stepmother's
present inside by accident.

174
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,914
I swear, when we're old and grey

175
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,916
you gonna have to remind me to put my teeth in.

176
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:35,295
I'll be walking all over
town smacking my gums
together, not even noticing.

177
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,382
I'll wait.
You'll wait? Oh, right.

178
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,468
No, don't wait, Walter.
Really, it's silly, you go ahead.
We're late anyway.

179
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,554
I'll be ten minutes behind you.

Tonight we're talking about wishes and dreams.

What's your wish this Christmas Eve?

198
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:33,937
What's your wish?
My wish is to turn the radio station.

No last names, Jonah.

205
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:53,499
You sound younger than
our usual callers.
How old are you?

206
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,708
JONAH:
I'm 8.

207

FIELDSTONE:
Eight? How come you're up so late?

208
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,295
JONAH:
It's not that late in Seattle.

FIELDSTONE:
Oh, of course,
you're absolutely right.

All right, what's your Christmas wish, Jonah?

211
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:06,178
JONAH: It's not for me, it's for my dad.
I think he needs a new wife.

FIELDSTONE:
You don't like the one he has now?

213

He doesn't have one now.
That's the problem.

Where's your mum?

She died.

Well, who can believe this?

217

but I think my Dad's worse.

218
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,404
FIELDSTONE:
Have you talked to your dad about it?

JONAH: No.
FIELDSTONE: Why not?

220
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,408
JONAH:
It's like it makes him sadder.

221

Aw, I can understand that.
Jonah, is your dad home right now?

00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:34,498
JONAH: Yeah.
What's he doing? Is he busy?

223
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,708
JONAH:
Not really, he's out on the deck.

224

FIELDSTONE:
I'm sure that I can help.
But I'm gonna need you to help me...

Trust me, Jonah.

how concerned you are about him.

gonna listen to your show again.

JONAH: There's someone
on the phone for you.

His name is Sam.
FIELDSTONE: Sam.

If you've just tuned in,
this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone

235
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,206
and tonight's topic is your wishes and dreams.

236
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:17,416
I got it.

237
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,167
We're on the line now with someone from Seattle.

00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,377
Hello.

239
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:24,298
Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Fieldstone
on Network America.

240
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:29,720
Okay. What are you selling tonight?
Micro-hibachis or knives?

241
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:33,015
FIELDSTONE:
No, I'm not selling anything.
I just wanna help.

242
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,100
I want you to know that your son called

243
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:38,687
and he asked me for some advice
on how you might find a new wife.

244
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,188
Who is this?

245
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:46,153
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone
of Network America.
And you are on the air.

246
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:50,490
You called a radio station?
FIELDSTONE: Sam, are you with me?

247
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,992
Yeah. Yes.

248
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,663
Your son feels that
since your wife's death
you've been very, very unhappy.

249
00:15:56,831 --> 00:16:00,334
And he is genuinely worried about you.

250
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:05,088
Get out here. Get out here.
Come on, now, I'm not
gonna go through this alone.

251
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:09,426
I think it's very hard for him
to talk to you about all this.

252
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:14,348
I thought maybe you and I
could talk, it would make Jonah
feel a little better. Sam?

253
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:18,018
Talk to her, Dad. She's a doctor.
Of what?

254
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,770
Her first name could be Doctor.

255
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:26,610
Please.

00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,821
Okay.
Okay. Good.

Now, I know this is difficult.
But how long ago did your wife die?

258
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:41,833
About a year and a half ago.
Aw. Have you had any relationships?

No.
No? Why not?

Uh, Marcia, or Dr. Fieldstone?
Dr. Marcia.

And I don't want to invade
your privacy...

Sure you do.

Go on, Sam. I'm listening. Sam.

266
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,075
But we're dealing with it.

you're a wonderful father.

You know, you can tell a lot
from a person's voice.

271

You certainly can.

But something must be missing
if Jonah still feels
that you're under a cloud.

Are you sleeping at night?

Oh, well, it was a million tiny, little things.

When you added them all up,
it just meant we were
supposed to be together.

And I knew it, I knew it
the very first time I touched her.

New Year's Eve.
Please don't
make me write it.

341
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:42,235
Listen to this: "Phone service
in the Chicago area was tied up
for two hours Christmas Eve

342
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:46,031
when some kid calls
a radio show and says that
his dad needs a new wife."

343
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,909
Two thousand women
called the station asking
for the guy's number.

344
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:53,705
I heard it. This kid
calls up and says,
"My dad needs a wife."

345
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:57,250
And the shrink practically forces
the guy and says,
"Do you want to talk about it."

346
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:59,544
And he says,
"No, as a matter of fact, I don't."

347
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,547
And then suddenly
for no reason at all
he start to talk

348
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:03,882
about how much he loved his wife

349
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:07,302
and how he just fell in love
with her like he was one
of those cows in Michigan.

350
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,429
What cows in Michigan?

351
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:12,807
It was on 60 Minutes
over those cows that got
zapped by stray voltage.

352
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:15,101
No one knows why.
And maybe it was Wisconsin.

353
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:19,814
But, anyway, I was listening
to him talk about how much
he loved his wife

354
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,733
and suddenly I was crying.

355

the mother the refrigerator
with the big red bow.

I tell you what it is: Two thousand
women calling a radio station
for a husband?

363
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,594
There are a lot of desperate
women out there
looking for love.

365

killed by a terrorist than
it is to get married over 40.

366

That is not true.
That statistic is not true.

367
00:23:57,311 --> 00:24:00,063
That's right, it's not true.
But it feels true.

368
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:01,397
It feels true because it's true.

369
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,109
There is practically
a whole book about how
that statistic is not true.

SAM: What possessed you
to give them our address?

489
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,177
They called and asked for it.

490
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,972
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle

491
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,684
you're the most attractive man
I ever lay ears on." Pfft.

492
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,312
Wait, wait.
They called?

493
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:22,732
How did they get our number?
Oh, let me guess.
You gave it to them.

494
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:26,152
You have to give them
your number or they
won't let you on the air.

495
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,031
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle.
I live in Tulsa."
Where's that?

496
00:32:30,741 --> 00:32:32,408
It's in Oklahoma.

497
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:35,411
You know where Oklahoma is?
Somewhere in the middle.

498
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:39,832
I'm not even gonna think
about what they're not
teaching you in school.

499
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,876
Yeah, somewhere in the middle.
And, generally speaking

500
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:46,464
we should rule out
anyone that doesn't
live near here.

501
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,341
She's willing to fly anywhere.

502
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:53,638
She looks like
my third-grade teacher.
I hated my third-grade teacher.

503
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:57,767
Wait a minute.
She is my third-grade teacher!

504
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:02,313
Aren't you gonna read any of these?
No. This is not how it's done.

505
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:06,817
I'd much rather just see somebody I like

506
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:11,405
and get a feeling about them,
ask them if they wanna
have a drink.

507
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,366
Or a slice of pizza?
Not dinner.

508
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:17,953
Not on the first date,
because halfway through dinner,
you could be really sorry.

509
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,955
Whereas, if it's just a drink

510
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,875
if you like them,
you can always
ask them to dinner.

511
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:26,921
If not, you can say,
"Well, that was great,"
and then you go home.

512
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:28,923
You see what I mean?

513
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,510
I wonder if it still works this way.

514
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:36,889
It doesn't. They ask you.
I'm starting to notice that.

515
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:41,560
If you get a new wife,
I guess you'll have sex
with her, huh?

516
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,729
I certainly hope so.

517
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:46,232
Will she scratch up your back?

518
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:48,359
What?

519
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:53,239
In movies, women always
scratch up the man's back
and screaming.

520
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:56,492
How do you know this?
Jed's got cable.

521
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,411
Oh, Jed's got...

522
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,082
Hand me that towel behind you.

523

Oh, well, it was...

560
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,456
Oh, it was a million tiny, little things.

561
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,667
When you added them all up

562
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:54,420
it just meant that we were
supposed to be together.

563
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:55,963
And I knew it.

564
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:59,049
I knew it the first time I touched her.

565
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:01,677
It was like coming home,

566
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:04,722
only to no home I'd ever known.

567
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,474
I was just taking her hand,

568
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,769
to help her out of a car.

569
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,981
And I knew it.

570
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,108
It was like

571
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,694
magic.

572
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:44,136
Well, I think I'm going
crazy, Dennis. I really do.
Are you happily married?

573
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:46,180
What?
I mean...

574
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:49,850
Why did you get married?
Was it trumpets and fireworks?

575
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:54,855
I got married because Betsy
said we had to break up
or get married. So we got married.

576
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,942
But when you first met her, did you believe

577
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:01,987
that she was the only person
for you, that in some mystical,
cosmic way

578
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:05,366
it was fated?
Annie,

579
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,702
when you're attracted
to someone, it means
your subconscious

580
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,830
is attracted to their subconscious,
subconsciously.

581
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:15,834
What we think of as fate
is just two neuroses
knowing they're a perfect match.

582
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:19,046
I don't even know him.

583

these fantasies about

I do not wanna move to Seattle.

588
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:38,023
But what I really don't wanna do

589
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:40,859
is end up always wondering
what might've happened

590
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:44,154
and knowing I could've done
something. What do you think?

591
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:49,410

before they get married.

what women are looking for:
Pecs and a cute butt.

Yeah.
