149
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:23,459
over and in a few weeks

150
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:27,660
Harry left smiling the living impaired

151
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,949
are known for haunting us my question is

152
00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:34,769
what's haunting them it's a lack of

153
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:35,839
resolution

154
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,070
ghosts are simply spirits without

155
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,500
resolution unfinished business

156
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,480
and it's my job to find out what that is

157
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,750
and so dr. James Harvey continues work
