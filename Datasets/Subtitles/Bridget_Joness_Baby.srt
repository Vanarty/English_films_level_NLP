1
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:37,513
Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday to me

2
00:01:38,347 --> 00:01:41,516
How in hell
did I end up here again?

3
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,686
Fuck off.

4
00:02:51,587 --> 00:02:56,425
My birthday actually
began the way of all my birthdays.

5
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,646
Hello, darling. Just ringing
to wish you a happy birthday!

6
00:03:10,772 --> 00:03:12,524
Mum? It's 6:00 a.m.

7
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,359
I'm doing the FaceTime.

8
00:03:14,443 --> 00:03:16,319
Una taught me.
It's really marvelous!

9
00:03:16,403 --> 00:03:17,778
Mum, the point of FaceTime

10
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,532
is that you haven't got
to put the phone to your ear.

11
00:03:20,616 --> 00:03:22,200
Oh! Silly me!

12
00:03:22,284 --> 00:03:23,451
Oh! There you are!

13
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,163
This time, 43 years ago,

14
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,625
I was having a lamb biryani
in an attempt to coax you out.

15
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:33,461
Twenty-three hours of labor.
Never been the same down there.

16
00:03:33,837 --> 00:03:35,671
It's a miracle,
the gift of childbirth.

17
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,007
Here it comes!

18
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:40,718
Penny Husband-Bosworth's son
sells his sperm on the Internet!

19
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,804
You don't even
need a man, Bridget.

20
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,264
Some people have
marvelous lives

21
00:03:44,348 --> 00:03:45,640
without them!
I mean, look at you.

22
00:03:45,807 --> 00:03:49,519
A nice flat, a lovely job.
Nice flat!

23
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,979
I'm putting the phone down
now, Mum.

24
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,816
Say happy birthday to Bridget.

25
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:55,984
Colin!

26
00:03:56,151 --> 00:03:57,860
Happy birthday to Bridget.

27
00:03:58,528 --> 00:03:59,695
Thank you!

28
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,282
I love you, darling.
Now don't forget,

29
00:04:02,366 --> 00:04:04,992
I'm counting on you
to head up my media campaign.

30
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:09,038
It's the parish council elections,
Mum. Not the US Primaries.

31
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,585
Annual phone call
from Mum reminding me

32
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:16,338
to take my ovaries
out of retirement.

33
00:04:16,505 --> 00:04:17,923
The truth was that by now,

34
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,384
I thought I would
have had a little baby to love

35
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,677
with the chisel-jawed
love of my life.

36
00:04:22,803 --> 00:04:26,473
But sometimes, life gives you
shallower compensations.

37
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,432
And at least
I was finally down

38
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,519
to my perfect weight.

39
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,853
Buongiorno, Miss Bridget.

40
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,316
There was life
in the old dog yet.

41
00:04:37,442 --> 00:04:40,112
Hadn't exactly
been put out to grass.

42
00:04:40,654 --> 00:04:42,197
Ding dong.

43
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:45,533
But this year,
all these things

44
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:47,411
were brought
into sharper focus

45
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:51,497
by an event I hadn't expected
to attend quite so soon.

46
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,095
Hi.

47
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,060
So, how are you feeling?
Are you okay?

48
00:05:12,144 --> 00:05:13,687
Mmm. Yeah.

49
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,605
Just can't believe
he's gone, really.

50
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:38,502
His death seems to have hit
the Eastern European

51
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,298
teenage modeling community
particularly hard.

52
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,845
They found the flight
recorder, but still no bodies.

53
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,016
Strangely fitting that he should
have died going down in the bush.

54
00:05:54,853 --> 00:05:57,021
Sorry. Oops.

55
00:05:57,105 --> 00:06:00,733
We are gathered
here to celebrate the life

56
00:06:00,942 --> 00:06:03,944
of Daniel Vivian Cleaver.

57
00:06:04,613 --> 00:06:09,701
Daniel was a kind
and wonderful son.

58
00:06:10,202 --> 00:06:12,161
Fuck. What
the fuck is he doing here?

59
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,206
A loving uncle
and brother.

60
00:06:14,456 --> 00:06:17,959
Oh, you know what he's like,
wanting to do the decent thing.

61
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,377
Is that his wife?

62
00:06:21,505 --> 00:06:24,216
Did I ever
get over losing Mr. Darcy?

63
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,802
Was he my Mr. Right?

64
00:06:26,968 --> 00:06:28,387
Oh, Christ.

65
00:06:28,553 --> 00:06:33,725
A man of outstanding
charm and charisma.

66
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:35,226
Just a bit emotional.

67
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:40,148
I would like to invite
his loved ones up to share

68
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:43,776
some of their
memories of Daniel.

69
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,822
Daniel could be
very sensitive.

70
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,574
Make you feel like you were
the only woman in the world.

71
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:52,119
I first met Daniel in Moscow.

72
00:06:52,202 --> 00:06:56,038
He once took me rowing on the
Serpentine and quoted Keats by heart.

73
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,374
He could quote
Keats by heart!

74
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,084
"Where be ye going,
you Devon Maid?

75
00:07:00,252 --> 00:07:03,422
"And what have ye
there in the basket?"

76
00:07:03,505 --> 00:07:05,089
"And what have ye
there in the basket?

77
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,220
"Ye tight little fairy
just fresh from the dairy,

78
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,848
"Will you give me
some cream if I ask it?"

79
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,519
He did it to everyone.

80
00:07:19,187 --> 00:07:22,565
Would anybody else
like to say a few words?

81
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,276
Say something for his mum.

82
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,197
Get up, go on.

83
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,086
Daniel was a man

84
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:50,759
who touched many of us
here today, including me.

85
00:07:54,764 --> 00:07:55,807
Oh, dear.

86
00:07:56,975 --> 00:08:00,103
This is when Daniel would say,
"Shut up, Jones. "

87
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:04,733
And he would be right because
all I really need to say is,

88
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:09,612
dear Daniel,
I will miss you terribly.

89
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:11,740
We all will.

90
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,954
Give you a call?
Yes, very good.

91
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,456
Bye, Bridget.
Bye. Bye.

92
00:08:20,707 --> 00:08:22,000
Oh!
Bridget.

93
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,084
Mark!

94
00:08:23,793 --> 00:08:24,836
This is Camilla.

95
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,961
Hello.

96
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,923
Bridget. An old friend.

97
00:08:28,048 --> 00:08:31,425
Well, less old, more
childhood!

98
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,389
So, nice memorial,

99
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,099
as memorials go.

100
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,436
Almost makes one look forward
to one's own.

101
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,649
Yes, well...

102
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,399
Goodbye.

103
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:49,443
Goodbye!

104
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:56,158
Maybe that's the reason
Mark Darcy and I never made it.

105
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,870
I always felt like a
verbally incontinent old maid

106
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,538
even when we were together.

107
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,832
Still, I wasn't going to
dwell on the negatives.

108
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,128
At least no one at work knew
it was my birthday.

109
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,548
Or, indeed,
how old I was going to be.

110
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:12,091
Surprise!

111
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,470
Happy birthday, Bridget! Gosh!

112
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,471
Or so I thought.

113
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,140
Who told you?

114
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,476
It's so hot. So many candles!

115
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:27,231
Happy 43rd birthday to you

116
00:09:27,357 --> 00:09:30,527
Happy 43rd birthday to you

117
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,321
Isn't there some sort
of statute of limitations

118
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,573
about the number of
sodding candles on a cake

119
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,408
once you get to a certain age?

120
00:09:38,326 --> 00:09:40,495
Josh, I need you
to see what Reuters

121
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,706
is saying about
the attacks on Ramallah.

122
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,582
We might need a live link.

123
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,168
I may have been another
year older and still single,

124
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,169
but I could
always take consolation

125
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:51,172
in my job as
top news producer.

126
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,384
So, how will I be
changing the world today?

127
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,386
Well, our main feature
is the exclusive interview

128
00:09:57,554 --> 00:10:00,514
with the Foreign
Secretary about NGochi.

129
00:10:00,682 --> 00:10:02,182
OMG. How did you do that?

130
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,144
NGochi.
NGochi.

131
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,352
You're good at that!
I know.

132
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:06,855
I've been practicing. NGochi.

133
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,023
NGochi.

134
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,231
NGochi.
NGochi.

135
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,278
NGochi? It's harder
than you think! NGochi.

136
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,739
Plus, have great new
30-something work colleagues

137
00:10:15,905 --> 00:10:18,240
who are not obsessed
with children and marriage.

138
00:10:18,408 --> 00:10:20,409
How do we plan on
celebrating tonight?

139
00:10:20,577 --> 00:10:22,370
Well, night out
with the gang.

140
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,205
Please say that
involves group sex.

141
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,539
Gang bangs?

142
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,957
We like to do that.

143
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,293
I know a smashing little club
round the back of Berwick Street.

144
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:30,879
Chance
would be a fine thing.

145
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,215
I'm beginning to think I've
passed my sexual sell-by date.

146
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,384
No! There are names for
women like you now, Bridge.

147
00:10:37,552 --> 00:10:39,428
You're a cougar.
You are a MILF.

148
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,556
I'm not a MILF.
I'm not even a mum.

149
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:45,100
I'm a spinster. I'm a SPILF.

150
00:10:45,352 --> 00:10:46,477
Three minutes
till we're on air.

151
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,313
It's called Voyeurz,
with a 'Z'.

152
00:10:49,481 --> 00:10:50,899
You tell them
that Cathy sent you.

153
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,900
And if you go on a Thursday,
there's a Chinese buffet,

154
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,778
all you can eat, as it were.

155
00:10:56,404 --> 00:10:58,239
But whose advice was,
nevertheless,

156
00:10:58,323 --> 00:11:00,075
sometimes a tad
too modern for me.

157
00:11:01,284 --> 00:11:03,662
It's me. Checking talkback.
Yep.

158
00:11:03,828 --> 00:11:05,455
You didn't freeze your eggs
by any chance, did you?

159
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,832
No. I imagine
they're hard-boiled by now.

160
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,918
You know what, Bridge?
This weekend,

161
00:11:11,086 --> 00:11:14,589
you and me need to go out and
get stuck into some serious...

162
00:11:14,756 --> 00:11:18,426
Binge drinking,
a dangerous scourge on society.

163
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,177
Is new legislation needed?

164
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,849
Bridget, Miranda. I've told you,
don't talk between the bongs.

165
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:27,769
Stick to the questions
on the cue cards.

166
00:11:27,852 --> 00:11:28,852
Miranda, cue.

167
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,438
The Foreign Secretary
will be live in the studio

168
00:11:31,606 --> 00:11:34,274
to talk about the looming
crisis in Muribundi.

169
00:11:35,068 --> 00:11:37,278
You could always try
online dating again.

170
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,947
The other night I was on
Tinder. Half an hour later,

171
00:11:40,115 --> 00:11:41,658
I'm having a three-way with...
Miranda, cue!

172
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:45,452
Prince Andrew, the Royal Special
Representative for Trade and Investment...

173
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,830
You did that on purpose.

174
00:11:46,913 --> 00:11:49,249
...has just written his
first children's book.

175
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,000
He had a massive cock.

176
00:11:53,086 --> 00:11:56,255
Live in the studio, I'm joined by
Foreign Secretary, George Wilkins,

177
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,134
who has just returned
from war-ravaged Muribundi...

178
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,844
Miranda, I'm in your ear.
Just follow my lead.

179
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,139
...where the assassination of
bloody dictator, Charles NGochi,

180
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,557
has resulted in civil war.
One take.

181
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:07,683
Come back to four. Four.

182
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,309
Minister,
was this a military coup?

183
00:12:09,477 --> 00:12:11,645
Well, the signs are that
NGochi's own generals

184
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,730
did take him out in
a rather bloody way.

185
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,315
Hi, Tom. Can't talk.

186
00:12:14,482 --> 00:12:15,692
How was
Daniel's memorial?

187
00:12:16,192 --> 00:12:19,403
It's just sad. I can't
believe he's gone, actually.

188
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:21,780
It's just sad. I can't
believe he's gone actually.

189
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:27,495
I don't think there was any
particular sadness in his passing.

190
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,914
His persecution of the Unbutu
people amounted to genocide.

191
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,834
That is well documented.

192
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,168
I know he had his faults.

193
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,378
Well, I know he
had his faults.

194
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,254
He could be
a massive arsehole.

195
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,548
He could be
a massive arsehole.

196
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,509
But I miss him. We all do.

197
00:12:42,677 --> 00:12:44,888
But I miss him. We all do.

198
00:12:46,222 --> 00:12:48,932
Well, he was certainly
a very colorful character

199
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,393
on the world stage, Miranda.

200
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,686
I grant you that.

201
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,229
But I think
the genocide resulting in

202
00:12:53,313 --> 00:12:55,190
the deaths of over
10,000 of his own people,

203
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,356
men, women and children,

204
00:12:56,524 --> 00:12:58,567
probably did rather put him
on the wrong side of history.

205
00:12:58,735 --> 00:13:00,736
At least he was never boring.

206
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,697
Well, at least
he was never boring.

207
00:13:04,115 --> 00:13:05,200
One, two
and three. Clear.

208
00:13:06,326 --> 00:13:07,619
Do you think
a spirit of democracy

209
00:13:07,702 --> 00:13:09,620
can carry over
into West Africa

210
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,288
now NGochi's dead?

211
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:13,875
Do you think, Minister,
that the spirit of democracy

212
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:17,253
can carry over into West
Africa now that NGochi is dead?

213
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,588
Now that is an interesting
question. Finally.

214
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,633
Running out of time here.
Miranda, wrap it up!

215
00:13:21,716 --> 00:13:22,716
Briefly, please, Minister.

216
00:13:22,884 --> 00:13:24,802
It is a complicated issue.
Yes or a no?

217
00:13:25,553 --> 00:13:26,888
Miranda,
make it the last answer.

218
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,222
Let's hope so.

219
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,642
I'll take that. Thank you for
joining us on the sofa today.

220
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,100
Stand by. Toby
on one. Over to you, Toby.

221
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:35,270
And now, what if a man
was to experience labor?

222
00:13:35,438 --> 00:13:37,440
Well, thank you,
Miranda, Bridget.

223
00:13:37,607 --> 00:13:39,317
You couldn't just
behave yourselves

224
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,567
when the new
management team were here?

225
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,320
They're the new
management team?

226
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,572
That is Alice Peabody,
new Brand Manager.

227
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,784
Apparently, Hard News is too
old-fashioned, too serious,

228
00:13:48,952 --> 00:13:50,953
and she is
the smiling assassin

229
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,081
brought in to sack
anybody older than her.

230
00:13:53,581 --> 00:13:55,124
Everybody's older
than her.

231
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:58,001
I've got tins of soup in
my cupboard older than her.

232
00:13:58,169 --> 00:13:59,754
Look at them all.

233
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:03,758
With their apps,
and their ironic beards.

234
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,759
Maybe one of them
could give Bridget some sex.

235
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:06,845
What?

236
00:14:07,011 --> 00:14:08,011
Does Brid... Do you need sex?

237
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:09,681
No!
Yes!

238
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,015
Which is why I'm taking her
on a girls' weekend

239
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,184
to beat all girls' weekends.

240
00:14:16,187 --> 00:14:18,105
Bridget, isn't it?

241
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,356
Yes. Nice to meet...

242
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:23,318
Team meeting tomorrow morning.
We can do introductions then.

243
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:31,702
9:00 a.m.

244
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,956
We should all start
an hour earlier from now on.

245
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,459
You think she saw that?

246
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:40,669
Quite possibly not.

247
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,505
And you're sure you don't wanna
come out with me and my crew?

248
00:14:44,674 --> 00:14:46,967
Thanks, but can't
let the old gang down.

249
00:14:47,135 --> 00:14:50,221
They're stay-at-home mums now.
They'd be disappointed.

250
00:15:04,235 --> 00:15:06,153
Thank God for the gays!

251
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:12,869
Now whatever fears you're
bringing in the room with you today,

252
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,745
I want you to
take those fears

253
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:17,414
and I want you to tell them
to fuck the fuck off!

254
00:15:17,582 --> 00:15:19,000
Yeah!

255
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,004
Are you ready for this? Are you
ready for this?

256
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:27,341
Then ride, you sexy bitches.
Ride!

257
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:30,177
Ride!

258
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,096
Look, I'm so sorry, Bridget,

259
00:15:33,264 --> 00:15:35,307
but I'm actually gonna
have to blow you out, too.

260
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,643
Oh!

261
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,187
I didn't wanna have
to tell you this today,

262
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,355
but Eduardo and
I are adopting.

263
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,607
"Adopting"?

264
00:15:44,192 --> 00:15:45,485
What, a baby?

265
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,486
Yes. A baby.

266
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:49,905
Or gayby, in our case.

267
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,866
That's fantastic news!

268
00:15:53,034 --> 00:15:53,993
Tom!

269
00:15:54,077 --> 00:15:55,119
Yeah.
I'm going to Bogotá tomorrow

270
00:15:55,203 --> 00:15:56,745
to start the paperwork,
so I've gotta go and pack.

271
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,538
Wonderful! Go!

272
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,042
Happy birthday. Have fun.

273
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,293
Congratulations!

274
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,378
Thanks, darling. Bye.

275
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,005
Fucking excellent.

276
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:11,385
And that was how
I wound up back here again.

277
00:16:11,552 --> 00:16:14,554
The last barren
husk in London.

278
00:16:14,722 --> 00:16:16,640
And of the two
loves of my life,

279
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:20,227
one is married,
and the other is dead.

280
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,982
Right.
New birthday resolutions.

281
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:27,735
I, Bridget Jones, am done
with affairs of the heart

282
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:31,905
and dedicating my autumn years
to the pursuit of hedonism.

283
00:16:32,073 --> 00:16:35,076
Will hang only with new,
free-spirited friends like Miranda.

284
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,995
And when the going gets tough,

285
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,998
the tough go on
a luxury spa weekend!

286
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,459
What the fuck?

287
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,421
Love the shoes.

288
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,770
I didn't tell you
because you wouldn't have come!

289
00:17:03,938 --> 00:17:05,772
Seriously,
it's been five years.

290
00:17:05,898 --> 00:17:07,607
You gotta shake
yourself out of this

291
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:09,484
self-imposed
purdah you've been in

292
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:12,739
ever since you split up
with your precious Mark Darcy.

293
00:17:12,905 --> 00:17:14,906
Rubbish.
I barely think of him.

294
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,076
What you need
is a good shafting.

295
00:17:17,243 --> 00:17:18,702
You need some
good old-fashioned,

296
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,122
lie-back-and-think-of-England
bonking.

297
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:23,915
And festivals are
sexual free-for-alls.

298
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:26,919
Like Sodom and Gomorrah,
with tofu.

299
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,130
First man you meet,
you gotta sleep with.

300
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,256
First man?

301
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:31,923
I'm not taking
no for an answer.

302
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:34,134
I'm gonna find our
backstage passes.

303
00:17:34,302 --> 00:17:35,761
You get the maps.

304
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,476
Wanna know where you are?

305
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:42,559
Maps!

306
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:44,479
I may be old and
inappropriately dressed,

307
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,397
but at least I look
fucking amazing!

308
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,152
Oh.

309
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:57,075
That's exactly why
I didn't wear my heels.

310
00:17:58,242 --> 00:17:59,951
Ding fucking dong!

311
00:18:00,244 --> 00:18:01,412
May I?

312
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,012
Thank you.

313
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:23,976
Ah. There you go.

314
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,353
It fits.

315
00:18:29,857 --> 00:18:31,192
Bridget!

316
00:18:32,443 --> 00:18:33,611
Bridget!

317
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,029
Is that your
wicked stepmother?

318
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,323
Yes.

319
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:41,160
I'd better go before she has
me sweeping fireplaces all day.

320
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,704
Thank you.
You're welcome.

321
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,209
Ah-ha. Birthday
resolution number two.

322
00:18:48,376 --> 00:18:49,961
Must remember
the way to a man's heart

323
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,546
is not through beauty,
sex or love...

324
00:18:52,088 --> 00:18:53,172
It's Jack.

325
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:57,050
...but merely the ability
to fall arse over tit in the mud.

326
00:18:57,635 --> 00:18:59,052
By the way.

327
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:01,721
Right.

328
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:03,182
Which one's ours?

329
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:05,183
Let's try up here.

330
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:08,729
And anyway, it's not
camping. It's glamping.

331
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:12,150
Putting a "GL" in front
of it doesn't make it any better.

332
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:13,567
Calling him Gladolf Hitler

333
00:19:13,734 --> 00:19:17,113
wouldn't suddenly make you
forget all the unpleasantness.

334
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,746
Oh. Fuck me!

335
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,336
NGochi!

336
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,342
NGochi!

337
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,346
NGochi!

338
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,354
It's 2:30
in the afternoon!

339
00:19:50,521 --> 00:19:52,355
I should be hoovering!

340
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,624
This is incredible!

341
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,250
We've got to get a photo!

342
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,419
Excuse me?

343
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:16,380
Do you mind if we ask
you to take a photo of us?

344
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,298
Yeah. Sure.
Thank you.

345
00:20:20,801 --> 00:20:22,553
All right. You ready?
Hey, what are you doing?

346
00:20:23,638 --> 00:20:25,972
I was taking a photo. I
thought you guys wanted a photo.

347
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,642
Yeah, we do. Of us.

348
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:28,808
Yes. Terribly sorry,

349
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,561
but we thought it would be really
fun to get a photo of us backstage

350
00:20:31,646 --> 00:20:33,314
among all these
glamorous people.

351
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,650
I think that's
the guy from Bargain Hunt.

352
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,609
It would be great if you
could get him in the shot.

353
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:38,986
Quick, quick, quick!

354
00:20:39,153 --> 00:20:40,613
So, you don't want me
in the photo at all?

355
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,823
Oh, God. You can lose
the attitude, babes.

356
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,616
Is it really that difficult?

357
00:20:45,117 --> 00:20:48,162
God. They let any old
riff-raff backstage nowadays.

358
00:20:48,329 --> 00:20:50,748
I don't know. I thought
he was kind of cute.

359
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,458
But he looks familiar.

360
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,962
I think he works at
the Starbucks in Balham!

361
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:05,512
Here we go!

362
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,515
One, two, three, sing!

363
00:21:14,355 --> 00:21:16,691
Oh, my God!

364
00:21:17,692 --> 00:21:18,901
I know!

365
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,944
It's the guy from Starbucks!

366
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,113
Crowd-surf!

367
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,134
Miranda!

368
00:21:44,885 --> 00:21:46,261
Miranda!

369
00:21:48,222 --> 00:21:49,640
Miranda?

370
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:51,892
Shit.

371
00:21:53,936 --> 00:21:55,104
Hey, Miranda.

372
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,148
Oh, God!

373
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:03,738
I have to admit that was fun.

374
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,324
And you're right.

375
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:10,411
What I need is
a good shafting.

376
00:22:11,078 --> 00:22:16,000
Some good old-fashioned
lie-back-and-think-of-England

377
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,419
bonking.

378
00:22:19,003 --> 00:22:20,253
Well, sign me up.

379
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,089
Oh, my God!

380
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:26,760
What are you doing
in my yurt?

381
00:22:28,262 --> 00:22:32,892
With all your clothes
and luggage and possessions.

382
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:36,061
Yeah. It's as if I've
come in, made it my own.

383
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:37,605
Wait, it's you.

384
00:22:37,772 --> 00:22:39,105
The creature from
the Black Lagoon.

385
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,107
Oh. Yes. Sorry.

386
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,777
Well, you don't
really expect me to believe

387
00:22:42,943 --> 00:22:45,112
that you accidentally crashed
into my yurt, do you?

388
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,447
Oh!

389
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,616
Since you're here,
maybe I could help you.

390
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:54,163
Well,
he is the first man I met.

391
00:22:54,288 --> 00:22:57,290
And his yurt is one heck
of a lot nicer than mine.

392
00:22:58,292 --> 00:22:59,542
Bridget!

393
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,546
Where the fuck are you?

394
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:03,881
Bridget!

395
00:23:04,048 --> 00:23:06,800
I'm so pissed!

396
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,388
Bridget!

397
00:23:54,807 --> 00:23:58,602
I'm zorbing with Ed Sheeran!

398
00:24:23,836 --> 00:24:27,131
Oh, God! I've just
slept with a complete stranger!

399
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,300
I'm nothing but
a feckless prostitute.

400
00:24:31,385 --> 00:24:33,511
No, no.
I'm an elegant older woman

401
00:24:33,596 --> 00:24:35,681
taking men for
my own pleasure.

402
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,224
Or am I just a deluded,
middle-aged fool?

403
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:47,859
Fuck it!

404
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:50,738
Miranda.

405
00:24:52,406 --> 00:24:53,824
Good morning.

406
00:24:55,868 --> 00:24:58,203
So, it lasted six hours?

407
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,580
What lasted
six hours, Mum?

408
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,876
A puppet show that
Auntie Bridge went to.

409
00:25:05,753 --> 00:25:07,837
Six-hour puppet show?

410
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:08,923
Hello.

411
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,759
So, tell me, were
they little puppets or...

412
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,801
Very nice-sized puppets.

413
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:19,933
And did he put
his puppet in your mouth?

414
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:26,565
God! I feel like my days of
puppet shows are behind me.

415
00:25:30,194 --> 00:25:31,778
I've had finger puppets.

416
00:25:34,865 --> 00:25:36,115
And has he called?

417
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:38,368
Well, it doesn't
work like that anymore.

418
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,955
You just hook up with rugged
troubadours at music festivals

419
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,624
and there are no strings.

420
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,917
Puppets with no strings.

421
00:25:47,461 --> 00:25:49,380
Take the wings off. They're
for little girls. Come on.

422
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,632
Hello?
Where the fuck are you?

423
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:53,384
Speeding through
lovely countryside

424
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:55,719
on our way to your
christening.

425
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,263
No, we're not.
Why is Auntie Bridget lying?

426
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,351
Bridge, I thought you should
know after Tom dropped out,

427
00:26:02,434 --> 00:26:04,103
Giles asked Mark
to be the godfather.

428
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,980
What?
He did what?

429
00:26:06,146 --> 00:26:07,815
Yes, I know.
He really is a useless cock.

430
00:26:07,982 --> 00:26:09,775
Did it without asking me.

431
00:26:11,443 --> 00:26:12,653
Oh, my God!

432
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,779
Mark Darcy again.

433
00:26:15,281 --> 00:26:19,617
Twice in the space of a week, I
turn up at church as rent-a-spinster.

434
00:26:23,414 --> 00:26:26,083
Where the fuck were you?

435
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:33,673
Sorry. Sorry.

436
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:35,968
Sorry.

437
00:26:37,886 --> 00:26:40,096
Good morning,
and welcome.

438
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,223
Well, this isn't
embarrassing at all.

439
00:26:42,308 --> 00:26:45,019
Mark Darcy and I at
the altar with a baby.

440
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,313
That's lovely.

441
00:26:47,396 --> 00:26:49,355
Okay, now. Nice big smiles.
Looking at me.

442
00:26:49,523 --> 00:26:51,692
Thank you. Lovely!

443
00:26:51,984 --> 00:26:54,486
Okay. Can I just get the
godparents now, please?

444
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:56,864
So, how are you?

445
00:26:57,281 --> 00:26:59,032
Very well, thank you.
How are you?

446
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,659
Well. Thank you.

447
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:04,788
Are you here with your wife?
I can't remember her name.

448
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:08,541
Camilla. No, she... No,
she couldn't make it.

449
00:27:08,792 --> 00:27:09,792
You with anyone?

450
00:27:09,877 --> 00:27:12,211
No, no. Not today. No.

451
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,173
Come on. It's not a funeral.

452
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,634
Can I get a couple of smiles
out of you two, please?

453
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,801
Maybe give her a little kiss?
You know, on the forehead there.

454
00:27:22,973 --> 00:27:24,307
I was talking
about the baby.

455
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,065
Lovely!

456
00:27:31,482 --> 00:27:32,816
All right.

457
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:33,858
I'll see you later,
I shouldn't wonder.

458
00:27:33,942 --> 00:27:34,942
Yeah.

459
00:27:35,069 --> 00:27:37,403
Unless I make a break
for it with this thing.

460
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:41,115
Could this day
actually get any more awkward?

461
00:27:41,742 --> 00:27:45,244
Just keep walking, keep walking,
keep walking, keep walking!

462
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,257
Hello.

463
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,384
Hello.

464
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,219
How are you?

465
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,221
Very well, thanks.
How are you?

466
00:28:02,388 --> 00:28:03,555
I'm fine.

467
00:28:03,722 --> 00:28:05,265
So am I.

468
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,059
Well, goodbye.

469
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,686
Goodbye.

470
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,855
A glass of wine.
A whiskey, please.

471
00:28:12,106 --> 00:28:13,606
Big. Big glass.
Double.

472
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,857
Thank you.

473
00:28:48,934 --> 00:28:51,228
I'd ask you to join me,
but I'm pretty sure

474
00:28:51,311 --> 00:28:54,355
you're not a big
Gangnam Style kind of guy.

475
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:56,066
I was only there very briefly.

476
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,108
Where?

477
00:28:57,192 --> 00:28:58,484
Gangnam.

478
00:29:00,154 --> 00:29:01,654
What are we talking about?

479
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,574
Gangnam. Dancing.

480
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,326
Not the suburb of Seoul.

481
00:29:06,952 --> 00:29:07,994
No.

482
00:29:08,078 --> 00:29:10,372
Not familiar with Gangnam,
the suburb.

483
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,665
It literally means
"South of the Han River. "

484
00:29:14,626 --> 00:29:18,713
It was inhabited as early
as the Paleolithic Period.

485
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:21,759
Suddenly seems so
much less catchy!

486
00:29:24,511 --> 00:29:26,346
Now something for
you lovers out there.

487
00:29:26,513 --> 00:29:28,640
We're entering
"the erection section. "

488
00:29:28,807 --> 00:29:30,851
Don't say fucking
"erection" at a christening!

489
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,188
Oh.

490
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:38,901
Would you like
to get some air?

491
00:29:41,695 --> 00:29:43,697
I mean, some more air.

492
00:29:44,865 --> 00:29:46,325
Sure.

493
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,961
I don't suppose you
happen to have a cigarette?

494
00:29:58,128 --> 00:29:59,128
No.

495
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:03,008
Gave up
1,891 days ago.

496
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,301
Not that you're counting.

497
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,054
Since when
did you smoke?

498
00:30:07,221 --> 00:30:10,223
I don't.
It's been a tense time.

499
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:13,477
Maybe I'm nervous.

500
00:30:15,145 --> 00:30:16,230
Why?

501
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:20,233
You have a train
in your hair.

502
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:24,488
I'm aware of that.

503
00:30:24,571 --> 00:30:27,240
Courtesy of one of
my many godchildren.

504
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:34,580
Seems to be stuck.

505
00:30:36,416 --> 00:30:37,917
And this would be...

506
00:30:39,086 --> 00:30:40,086
Cake?

507
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,337
Profiterole.

508
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,799
It's technically more of a
dessert than a cake, I suppose.

509
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,849
What are you doing?
You're married.

510
00:30:52,933 --> 00:30:54,101
No, I'm not.

511
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:58,396
I mean, I am.
I'm getting a divorce.

512
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,356
That's why she's not here.

513
00:31:04,069 --> 00:31:06,363
Weren't you together
at the memorial?

514
00:31:06,905 --> 00:31:09,074
No. She was just
being supportive.

515
00:31:09,366 --> 00:31:12,118
She's gone back to The Hague,
where she's now living and I'm not.

516
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,372
Oh, I'm so sorry, Mark.

517
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:18,458
Right at this precise moment,
I'm not sorry at all.

518
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,286
How the fuck am I supposed
to get in here?

519
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,173
Again?

520
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,468
Mr. Darcy.

521
00:32:51,551 --> 00:32:52,551
Wow.

522
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:56,765
Bridget.

523
00:33:00,394 --> 00:33:02,186
God, I've missed you.

524
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:10,569
Are we on schedule?

525
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,990
I have a flight to
Khartoum tomorrow.

526
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:54,197
I'm so sorry, Mark.
Had to leave.

527
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:57,451
Probably sounds pathetic,
but I got scared.

528
00:33:57,617 --> 00:34:00,244
The fact that we went round and
round for the best part of 10 years

529
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:04,249
without ever making it across
the finish line leads me to think

530
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:07,419
we did the best thing
by ending it when we did.

531
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:12,965
Sometimes it feels scary
still being on my own at 43,

532
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,342
but you and I have
been here once before.

533
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:20,389
We always loved
the fantasy of us,

534
00:34:20,557 --> 00:34:21,974
but the reality,
as we both know,

535
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:23,559
is quite different.

536
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:25,519
Ta-da!

537
00:34:31,985 --> 00:34:35,155
We could both come up with 100
reasons why we didn't make it.

538
00:34:35,322 --> 00:34:36,447
But in the end...

539
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:40,994
I always felt that you were never
there and I was mostly alone.

540
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:56,134
No, can't go back
and keep making same mistakes.

541
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:59,512
Must keep moving forward
and make new ones.

542
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:03,349
And will launch myself
into frenzied keep-fit regime.

543
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,644
Am allowing four weeks
to reduce thigh circumference

544
00:35:06,853 --> 00:35:10,315
in order to squeeze lardy arse
into teenage skinny jeans.

545
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,652
Obviously not meant
for women of a certain age.

546
00:35:15,112 --> 00:35:18,657
All this bloody cycling
is pointless. I'm putting on weight.

547
00:35:18,824 --> 00:35:20,534
Let's rule out some of the
other options, shall we?

548
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:22,327
You're not pregnant, are you?

549
00:35:22,869 --> 00:35:24,204
Of course not.

550
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,664
A lady is always prepared.

551
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,333
And I always carry
these in my handbag.

552
00:35:29,501 --> 00:35:32,045
Oh, God!
You didn't use those?

553
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,838
The vegan condoms?

554
00:35:34,005 --> 00:35:36,048
"Biodegradable and
dolphin-friendly. "

555
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:39,719
If I'm going to be slutty, it's nice
to think I'm helping the environment.

556
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:40,804
Christ.

557
00:35:41,054 --> 00:35:44,056
Bridget, I remember
when you bought those!

558
00:35:44,224 --> 00:35:45,809
That was decades ago!

559
00:35:45,976 --> 00:35:48,353
Sell-by dates
don't mean anything.

560
00:35:49,563 --> 00:35:50,563
Do they?

561
00:35:52,065 --> 00:35:53,065
They were a gift.

562
00:35:53,233 --> 00:35:54,525
Don't ask.

563
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,987
Tumbling rapids,

564
00:35:58,155 --> 00:36:00,407
frothing waterfalls,

565
00:36:00,574 --> 00:36:02,784
a babbling brook!

566
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:07,581
Oh, come the fuck on, Bridget.

567
00:36:20,427 --> 00:36:22,429
How long do you
think it takes?

568
00:36:24,764 --> 00:36:27,266
I think that's
a positive result.

569
00:36:31,521 --> 00:36:32,731
I'll just make sure.

570
00:36:32,898 --> 00:36:34,900
Oh, don't shake it.
You'll hurt the baby!

571
00:36:35,108 --> 00:36:37,360
The baby's not
in the stick, Bridget.

572
00:36:38,862 --> 00:36:42,740
I think this is when
you're meant to jump for joy.

573
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:44,951
Oh, my God.

574
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,577
Oh, my God.
You're pregnant.

575
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,038
I'm pregnant?

576
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,581
You're pregnant.

577
00:36:50,123 --> 00:36:51,625
I'm pregnant.

578
00:36:51,791 --> 00:36:53,751
You're going
to have a baby.

579
00:36:53,835 --> 00:36:56,463
I'm going to have a baby.

580
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,052
I'm going to have a baby.

581
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,221
Yeah.

582
00:37:08,391 --> 00:37:11,978
If you've got footage of her
punching a horse, I want it.

583
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,980
Bridget,
do you want a baby?

584
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:16,733
I don't know.

585
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,652
I mean, I'm 43.

586
00:37:19,527 --> 00:37:22,197
It might be the only
chance I'm going to get.

587
00:37:22,614 --> 00:37:25,532
Look, one broken,
out-of-date condom

588
00:37:25,617 --> 00:37:27,661
I might have
believed was an accident.

589
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,621
But two?

590
00:37:31,539 --> 00:37:32,873
You wanted it.

591
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,710
Maybe I did.

592
00:37:38,838 --> 00:37:40,340
Can we get a medic, please?

593
00:37:44,844 --> 00:37:48,514
Oh, my God!
I'm pregnant!

594
00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:50,976
This is it!

595
00:37:51,518 --> 00:37:54,688
More to the point,
whose is it?

596
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:59,025
This is not how I thought
this moment would be.

597
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:04,489
Always imagined myself in OK!
magazine with the man of my dreams.

598
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:07,701
Oh, Christ.
Too many dilemmas to ponder.

599
00:38:07,867 --> 00:38:12,204
Not least of all, who was
that man I shagged in a tent?

600
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:17,335
And so, your age will be 43?

601
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:27,262
So, which of the times
with my wonderful man

602
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,556
do you think
we got pregnant on?

603
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,141
Does it matter?

604
00:38:31,224 --> 00:38:34,978
Well, yes.
It's such a special moment.

605
00:38:35,061 --> 00:38:37,856
We'd like to know which one
it is, so we can treasure it.

606
00:38:38,023 --> 00:38:40,025
Can't you
treasure both of them?

607
00:38:40,108 --> 00:38:41,108
Oh. Yes. We will.

608
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,277
I mean, we do,

609
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:46,572
but surely one of those dates
is more likely than the other?

610
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:52,996
Well, actually, day 10, which
was his birthday, is a little early.

611
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:55,914
And day 16, which was the...

612
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,083
Anniversary dinner.

613
00:38:57,251 --> 00:39:00,420
Ah, yes. The osso buco,
I recall, is a little late.

614
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:04,048
Are you sure there wasn't another
treasurable occasion in between?

615
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,760
Yes, I'm quite sure.
He was away.

616
00:39:09,429 --> 00:39:11,639
So, which of the two
would you go for?

617
00:39:11,806 --> 00:39:13,474
Couldn't say.
They're both equally likely.

618
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,351
It could've been after the
events because as you know

619
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,771
sperm can live for several
days after ejaculation.

620
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,606
Couldn't you just have
a guess for me? No.

621
00:39:20,815 --> 00:39:22,067
What about the first scan?

622
00:39:22,233 --> 00:39:24,443
Would that show
when conception took place?

623
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,905
No. Ring this number
to fix a date.

624
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:30,742
And do bring along the father if
you can work out which one he is.

625
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:33,452
Right.

626
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:35,871
Right.

627
00:39:36,539 --> 00:39:37,623
Just out of interest...

628
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:43,380
If someone did have an element
of confusion about the father...

629
00:39:43,463 --> 00:39:45,798
Well, you can get a DNA sample
at the amniocentesis.

630
00:39:45,882 --> 00:39:49,677
And I do recommend that
you have the amniocentesis

631
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,846
because there are always more
risks with a geriatric mother.

632
00:39:54,182 --> 00:39:55,474
"Geriatric"?

633
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,309
That's outrageous.

634
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,644
Indeed.

635
00:40:00,188 --> 00:40:02,356
Unless you can sign on
for your child support

636
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,525
and pension at the same time.

637
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,445
That's hilarious.

638
00:40:09,614 --> 00:40:12,199
It's called "news"
'cause it should feel new.

639
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:15,202
Otherwise,
it would be called "olds. "

640
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:16,663
Sorry.

641
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:20,041
Last night, top stories.

642
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:21,333
Earthquake in Asia.

643
00:40:21,501 --> 00:40:22,585
Seen it before.

644
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,170
Car crash on the M5,
blah, blah, blah.

645
00:40:25,338 --> 00:40:26,463
We are making olds.

646
00:40:27,507 --> 00:40:29,300
We need to flip the switch,
mix it up.

647
00:40:29,467 --> 00:40:31,052
I want to NutriBullet
the shit out of the news.

648
00:40:31,219 --> 00:40:33,512
She's on the warpath. Susan
the Floor Manager's gone.

649
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,849
She's six months pregnant.

650
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,684
We've got to
grab the attention!

651
00:40:37,851 --> 00:40:39,476
Get the eyes on the screen!

652
00:40:39,644 --> 00:40:44,273
I want to see headlines like "Is
your sofa bed giving you cancer?"

653
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,485
"Is your freezer
giving you Alzheimer's?"

654
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,195
Oh, my God. Are they?

655
00:40:49,362 --> 00:40:51,655
Literally no evidence whatsoever,
but you're missing the point.

656
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,074
You're intrigued, aren't you?

657
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:58,204
I want to re-launch Hard News
with a clear new objective.

658
00:40:58,371 --> 00:41:01,416
We have a presentation in 12
weeks at the London Media Show,

659
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:05,586
and I am looking for someone
dynamic, innovative, focused,

660
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,338
to lead the charge.
Any volunteers?

661
00:41:08,715 --> 00:41:11,342
Whatever happens now,
must hold on to job.

662
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:14,554
Must prove to fascist boss
that I may be single mother,

663
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:17,599
but am willing to roll with
the ironic-bearded hipsters.

664
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:18,849
Anybody at all?

665
00:41:20,393 --> 00:41:21,768
Do you need the loo, Bridget?

666
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:24,731
No. I want to volunteer.

667
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,567
#Let's do this.

668
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,619
It's me, it's me.
Turn on your TV now.

669
00:41:38,786 --> 00:41:41,039
Look at your TV.
Now! Now! Now!

670
00:41:41,414 --> 00:41:42,748
Turn on Channel 4.

671
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:50,088
Bridget, I found him!
He's the dating website guru!

672
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:52,675
See, you have to
trust the science.

673
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,344
Algorithms don't lie.

674
00:41:54,427 --> 00:41:57,472
You only slept with
a fucking billionaire!

675
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:02,559
So, tell us, Bridget,

676
00:42:02,894 --> 00:42:04,561
what was it that
initially attracted you

677
00:42:04,646 --> 00:42:06,271
to the billionaire,
Jack Quant?

678
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,940
Was it his face or his body?

679
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:09,025
Yeah. Well,
I'd do him, obviously.

680
00:42:09,108 --> 00:42:10,068
Big dick?

681
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:11,818
If I were you, I
wouldn't tell either of them.

682
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,780
All you need's a DNA sample
from one of them.

683
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,909
And then you can eliminate the
other one from your enquiries.

684
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,077
What would I say to Mark?

685
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,496
"Hello, Mark. I know
I just left you asleep,

686
00:42:22,664 --> 00:42:24,123
"but I don't suppose
you've got any blood,

687
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,458
"sperm, or old fingernails
lying around?"

688
00:42:26,751 --> 00:42:28,545
But how would you even
get in touch with Jack?

689
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,172
Yeah.

690
00:42:31,965 --> 00:42:35,635
He is a bloody mogul.
Can't just ring him up.

691
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:38,096
Oh!

692
00:42:38,179 --> 00:42:41,932
May havejust worked out
how to win favor with new boss

693
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,936
and eliminate one father
from my enquiries.

694
00:42:45,311 --> 00:42:47,355
I have to say, Bridget.

695
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:49,983
I'm actually excited
about this next guest.

696
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,318
Relevant, relatable,

697
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:55,153
extremely fuckable. Good work.

698
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:58,532
Welcome to CSI Hard News.

699
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:00,159
One minute left
on the VT now. Out on Simon.

700
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:02,327
Bring in next five,
stand by. Thank you.

701
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:09,710
Thank you, my love. If
you could just fuck off,

702
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:11,378
that would be great.

703
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:19,304
Jack, this is Cathy.
She'll get you ready.

704
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:20,679
Hi, Cathy.
Jack.

705
00:43:20,847 --> 00:43:22,139
Nice to meet you.
I was just thinking

706
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:23,724
like a simple
magenta eye-shadow.

707
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:26,728
Make your eyes pop, and
little bit of rouge, maybe?

708
00:43:27,353 --> 00:43:29,230
Kidding.

709
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:30,481
You're funny.

710
00:43:30,565 --> 00:43:31,565
Yeah, but you do
happen to have

711
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,358
a little stray
gray hair there.

712
00:43:33,568 --> 00:43:35,360
There we are.
Jesus.

713
00:43:35,528 --> 00:43:36,653
That's it.

714
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:39,197
Actually, there's a whole gray
patch up there. Shall I just...

715
00:43:39,282 --> 00:43:40,742
Yeah. Let me see.
Let's just get in there.

716
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:42,117
Yeah, my hair is
full of gray hair.

717
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:43,244
That's it.
I've sorted it.

718
00:43:43,536 --> 00:43:44,621
Okay.

719
00:43:44,704 --> 00:43:46,121
Jesus Christ.
Okay.

720
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,458
All gone.
Yeah, that's lovely. Oh.

721
00:43:48,916 --> 00:43:51,668
These fingernails
on this silver fox

722
00:43:51,753 --> 00:43:53,463
could do with a bit of a trim,
couldn't they?

723
00:43:54,422 --> 00:43:57,800
These hands haven't experienced
much manual labor, have they?

724
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,217
No. I'm a mathematician.

725
00:43:59,385 --> 00:44:00,719
They're silky soft.

726
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:02,512
Tell me, Jack.

727
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:05,974
Do you happen to
like Chinese food?

728
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,103
Jack. Let me take you to set.

729
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:10,271
Great. Thank you.

730
00:44:10,438 --> 00:44:12,065
I do, sometimes.
Yes. Thank you.

731
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:13,858
I don't think
she put any makeup on me.

732
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:16,027
It's fine.
You look radiant.

733
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:22,282
Okay. Coming out of VT in five,
four... And remember the gear shift.

734
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:23,659
And Miranda, cue.

735
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,371
But now, though,
I'm joined by Jack Quant.

736
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:28,289
Raised by a single
mother in Baltimore,

737
00:44:28,831 --> 00:44:31,458
he created the matchmaking
website, Qwantify,

738
00:44:31,626 --> 00:44:34,961
and he claims to have
found an algorithm for love.

739
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:38,382
And he's here today to tell us all
about his number one best-seller

740
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,884
Qwantum Leap.

741
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:44,179
It is absolutely wonderful
to have you on our sofa today.

742
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:45,264
Thank you.
It's great to be here.

743
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:48,226
Now, we'll talk all
about your new book soon.

744
00:44:48,393 --> 00:44:49,393
Obviously.
Yes.

745
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:51,019
But first,
let's talk about romance.

746
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:54,023
Qwantify has found true
love for millions.

747
00:44:54,315 --> 00:44:56,108
Coming to two.
Has it worked for you?

748
00:44:56,275 --> 00:44:58,985
Now if I answer that, can we
go back and talk about the book?

749
00:44:59,153 --> 00:45:00,487
Maybe.

750
00:45:00,655 --> 00:45:02,864
Can you please try
not to shag him on air.

751
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,076
This is dynamite. Tell
her to flirt with him more.

752
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:09,371
Some people had their first
crush on Farrah Fawcett.

753
00:45:09,539 --> 00:45:12,166
My first crush
was an algorithm.

754
00:45:12,333 --> 00:45:14,418
And we've lost them! If he carries
on talking about algorithms,

755
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:16,878
I'm cutting to the VT
of cats who look like Hitler.

756
00:45:16,963 --> 00:45:18,088
Back to four.
Love it. Thank you.

757
00:45:18,172 --> 00:45:20,842
He's avoiding the question!
Get him off maths.

758
00:45:20,925 --> 00:45:23,260
Ask him if
he's with someone now.

759
00:45:23,344 --> 00:45:26,806
For someone so
good at matchmaking,

760
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:30,059
is there a special
someone in your life?

761
00:45:30,226 --> 00:45:32,853
Apart from Lady Mary
on Downton Abbey?

762
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:34,355
Now, can we go ahead
and talk about the book?

763
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:35,606
Cue Hitler cats!

764
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:36,733
Don't be evasive.

765
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,275
Oh, don't be evasive.

766
00:45:38,443 --> 00:45:40,402
It's apparent
you have everything.

767
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:42,320
Why have you chosen
to have no family...

768
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:44,532
Why the decision to
have no family and...

769
00:45:44,615 --> 00:45:45,824
No children?

770
00:45:46,409 --> 00:45:47,659
And no children?

771
00:45:48,202 --> 00:45:49,871
Brilliant.
Zoom in on four.

772
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:51,289
Go on four.
Love it.

773
00:45:51,831 --> 00:45:53,416
Look, I love kids.

774
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:56,251
But I've always found
the idea of being a father

775
00:45:56,335 --> 00:45:57,961
myself kind of petrifying.

776
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:01,090
Which is why I've been
drawn to algorithms.

777
00:46:01,257 --> 00:46:02,842
Cue Hitler cats!

778
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,677
They're rational,
reliable, predictable.

779
00:46:06,304 --> 00:46:08,306
Everything a kid isn't.

780
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:09,974
So, can you have children?

781
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,851
And can you have children,
though? I mean...

782
00:46:12,268 --> 00:46:14,269
Are the soldiers working?

783
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,773
Are the soldiers working?

784
00:46:16,898 --> 00:46:17,898
What?

785
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,568
Well, I believe so.

786
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:25,155
The barracks are in
pretty regular use.

787
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,615
Really?
Really?

788
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:27,824
Yes.

789
00:46:27,909 --> 00:46:30,327
Because for someone with a
supposed algorithm for love...

790
00:46:30,411 --> 00:46:32,663
Isn't it odd that
you've never found it?

791
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,916
Well, I think in
order to find something,

792
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,541
you have to be
actively looking for it.

793
00:46:36,626 --> 00:46:38,668
I've just been too busy,
so I haven't.

794
00:46:38,836 --> 00:46:41,255
What about
the Quant family bloodline?

795
00:46:41,422 --> 00:46:42,840
And what about
the Quant family bloodline?

796
00:46:43,007 --> 00:46:45,217
Are there any
skeletons in the closet?

797
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:46,302
Sexual deviants?

798
00:46:46,427 --> 00:46:48,346
Sexual deviants?

799
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:51,431
I'm sorry. I don't know where
we're going with all of this,

800
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:54,643
but I have to tell you, I can
attract the wrong type of women.

801
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:59,565
That's really great. Thanks
for sharing that with us.

802
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:01,650
Fuck.

803
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:03,527
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

804
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:04,778
Bridget, what are you doing?

805
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,532
You wouldn't believe some of
the weirdos that cross my path.

806
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:08,699
Really?

807
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,159
Get up!
Fuck, fuck.

808
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,327
Can you tell me
what she's doing?

809
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,246
Ask him something
about algorithms.

810
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,414
This has to be
the last question. Has to be.

811
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,208
Lastly, algorithms.

812
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:22,420
Yes. What first attracted you to them?

813
00:47:22,588 --> 00:47:23,922
The logic, and...
Wonderful.

814
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:26,675
Jack Quant, thank you
for coming on my sofa.

815
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,510
I hope you've had as
much fun as I have.

816
00:47:28,594 --> 00:47:29,554
Jesus.

817
00:47:29,637 --> 00:47:31,597
That's it from me. Goodbye.

818
00:47:34,016 --> 00:47:35,016
That was great.

819
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:37,978
You look really familiar,
outside of being on the show.

820
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:39,188
Are you on Tinder?

821
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,273
What?

822
00:47:40,398 --> 00:47:42,315
Then we won't have met.
No. Okay.

823
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:49,114
Well, hey!
How about seeing you here.

824
00:47:49,282 --> 00:47:52,242
Hi.
Great to see you.

825
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:53,452
Great to see you, too.

826
00:47:53,619 --> 00:47:55,954
I was going to come
and find you to say hello,

827
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:58,916
but you know how live TV
can be so chaotic!

828
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,960
Well, you know there are easier
ways of getting in touch with me

829
00:48:01,043 --> 00:48:04,880
than inviting me on national
TV and asking me about my sperm.

830
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:07,925
No. That's not what... No.

831
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,344
I would have liked to
have heard from you.

832
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:14,724
I was disappointed when I came
back that morning and you'd gone.

833
00:48:14,932 --> 00:48:16,182
You were?

834
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:18,311
We had an amazing night.

835
00:48:19,186 --> 00:48:20,730
And I thought you were great.

836
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,356
At least I did
until I became a clip

837
00:48:22,523 --> 00:48:25,693
of the 50 most embarrassing
chat show moments of all time.

838
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:30,072
Really sorry about that.
Yes, that...

839
00:48:31,532 --> 00:48:35,202
I don't know how to, explain.

840
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:42,668
I'm pregnant.

841
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:45,922
Wow. Okay.

842
00:48:48,007 --> 00:48:51,385
That's so much better than
you being mentally unbalanced.

843
00:48:51,552 --> 00:48:54,722
I'm about 12 weeks.

844
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:00,226
Oh. Right. Wow.

845
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,981
So, you mean
it's the music festival.

846
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,192
Yes.

847
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:09,027
I know, it's quite a
surprise!

848
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:10,905
Yes...

849
00:49:11,364 --> 00:49:12,364
But...

850
00:49:13,157 --> 00:49:15,242
I'm fine.

851
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:18,579
And you should know
that I don't... I'm not...

852
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,914
I'm not looking for
anything from you.

853
00:49:21,123 --> 00:49:23,125
Well, except for
a complete DNA check

854
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,210
and review of
my medical records.

855
00:49:25,795 --> 00:49:27,755
Well, the thing is
that I didn't mean

856
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:30,675
for you to find out
about this yet.

857
00:49:31,092 --> 00:49:35,179
And I'm feeling,
a bit foolish right now.

858
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:39,016
Mortified, actually.
Yes. I'm mortified.

859
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:44,896
And, I'd like to just
retreat gracefully.

860
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:47,148
Mr. Quant,
will you sign my book?

861
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,775
Please.

862
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:50,360
Oh, God.

863
00:49:50,528 --> 00:49:53,489
I didn't even tell him
he may not be the only daddy.

864
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:54,990
I love this book.

865
00:49:55,074 --> 00:49:58,369
Hey, Katie Couric!
I need to talk to you!

866
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,998
What if this DNA
turns out to be Jack's?

867
00:50:02,081 --> 00:50:03,833
Do I want
the father to be Jack?

868
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,710
I don't even know Jack.

869
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,670
And what if it's Mark Darcy's?

870
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,755
Christ.
I'll have to confess to him

871
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,673
I've been a whore
with dolphin condoms.

872
00:50:11,757 --> 00:50:12,757
Good.

873
00:50:13,342 --> 00:50:14,552
So, the baby's okay?

874
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:15,719
Perfect.

875
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:18,139
See?

876
00:50:18,931 --> 00:50:20,974
Oh, my God. Is that it?

877
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:28,565
And it's all right?

878
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:31,277
Sound as a bell.
Cooking nicely.

879
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,153
Have a listen.

880
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:42,871
There you are.
I've recorded that for you.

881
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:44,123
You can watch
that for a moment.

882
00:50:47,001 --> 00:50:49,420
So glad you've decided
on the amniocentesis.

883
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:53,882
Hello, you.

884
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,344
Is that your ear or your foot?

885
00:50:58,262 --> 00:51:00,722
You have got very big feet.

886
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:05,643
Oh, and look at you,
waving already.

887
00:51:05,936 --> 00:51:06,978
Hi.

888
00:51:12,693 --> 00:51:15,320
You're the best thing
I've ever seen.

889
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:22,327
I promise I'll try my best.

890
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:27,583
So, you just stay safe
and snug in there

891
00:51:28,501 --> 00:51:31,253
while I try and
sort the mess out here.

892
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:33,213
And hopefully...

893
00:51:34,632 --> 00:51:36,050
What the fuck is that?

894
00:51:36,675 --> 00:51:38,469
It's the amniocentesis needle.

895
00:51:38,969 --> 00:51:42,639
We just pop it in, take a little amniotic
fluid, test it for any abnormalities,

896
00:51:42,807 --> 00:51:44,432
and also the DNA sample
that you require.

897
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:47,519
Now, there is the slightest
risk of miscarriage.

898
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,188
So, you'll have to stay
very still indeed because

899
00:51:49,271 --> 00:51:50,688
we don't want the needle
to come into contact...

900
00:51:50,773 --> 00:51:53,025
What? No, no.

901
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:56,070
I'm not taking that chance.
And it's enormous.

902
00:51:56,237 --> 00:51:58,030
It'd go straight
through the other side.

903
00:51:58,572 --> 00:52:01,032
Come on, I'm taking you home.

904
00:52:05,871 --> 00:52:07,664
Your mother will
be over the moon.

905
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:11,543
Will you promise not to
tell her? Just not yet.

906
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:13,878
No, no.
Of course. No, no. I promise.

907
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:16,005
Really sorry, Dad.

908
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:18,509
Not to know
about the father.

909
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:20,844
Don't be daft.

910
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:23,389
I know dozens of people
who could have been anybody's.

911
00:52:23,931 --> 00:52:26,099
So, you're not disappointed?

912
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:28,686
You don't think
I belong on Jerry Springer?

913
00:52:28,894 --> 00:52:30,938
Not a bit. I'm thrilled.

914
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,150
Actually,
I'm not sure if you're mine,

915
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:37,902
or that nice Lieutenant
Colonel's who ran the bowls club.

916
00:52:39,405 --> 00:52:42,282
Only joking.
You've got my feet.

917
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:44,492
I've always had
very dainty feet.

918
00:52:47,079 --> 00:52:49,123
Just tell the truth,
Bridget.

919
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:52,001
Can't go too far wrong
telling the truth.

920
00:53:03,304 --> 00:53:06,139
"Mark,
I have some exciting news. "

921
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:09,351
"Mark, I have the funniest
story to tell you. "

922
00:53:09,518 --> 00:53:11,478
"Mark, I'm up the duff. "

923
00:53:12,188 --> 00:53:14,063
My Lords, my Ladies.

924
00:53:14,315 --> 00:53:17,443
There is only one fraud committed
here today and it is this.

925
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:22,072
To use the laws of one country to
destroy the freedom of speech of another.

926
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:24,782
A cynical political
expedient to take away

927
00:53:24,867 --> 00:53:26,577
the right of these
brave young women

928
00:53:26,744 --> 00:53:30,164
to speak the truth
about the country they love.

929
00:53:30,998 --> 00:53:33,918
Now you may not
like their music.

930
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:36,628
And for that,
I cannot blame you.

931
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:40,423
They may not have mastered
the fundamentals of melody,

932
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:42,800
or even the most basic
tenets of musicianship.

933
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:47,681
But this is the land of
Shakespeare, Orwell, Lawrence.

934
00:53:48,432 --> 00:53:51,184
Oh. I'd forgotten just
how hot he is in that wig and gown.

935
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:52,894
...to any country,

936
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:56,231
any ruler, any despot, that
here, in the United Kingdom,

937
00:53:56,398 --> 00:53:59,360
we will always defend and
protect women such as these

938
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:02,528
who have selflessly and
courageously risked their liberty

939
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:04,697
and quite possibly their lives

940
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:08,077
to tell the truth.

941
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:11,038
The court will now adjourn and
judgment will be given in due course.

942
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:13,414
Poonani! Poonani!
Power to the Poonani!

943
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,500
Poonani!

944
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:16,751
Christ. I'm looking
forward to going back

945
00:54:16,835 --> 00:54:18,545
to some good
old-fashioned genocide.

946
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:22,507
Silence! Silence!

947
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:29,597
Right.
How to do this?

948
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,099
I wasn't expecting
to see you again

949
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:32,768
after the events
at the christening.

950
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,228
Crap.
He's dived right in.

951
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:37,188
No. Right. I understand.

952
00:54:37,398 --> 00:54:38,898
Okay.
Maybe flattery will work.

953
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:40,775
You were very impressive
in there today.

954
00:54:40,943 --> 00:54:42,193
Thank you.

955
00:54:42,987 --> 00:54:44,570
Although dealing with them
over the last month

956
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:47,574
has given me a certain amount of
sympathy for the totalitarian dictator

957
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:49,367
who wants to silence them.

958
00:54:50,369 --> 00:54:53,539
Okay. Jokes.
Will laugh harder next time.

959
00:54:54,039 --> 00:54:56,541
There's only a certain
number of times one can listen

960
00:54:57,001 --> 00:55:00,838
to the resolutely un-catchy
Menstruation, Castration, Liberation.

961
00:55:02,548 --> 00:55:03,757
Mark.

962
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:06,635
That's hilariously funny.

963
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:14,309
Please.

964
00:55:23,485 --> 00:55:24,485
So...

965
00:55:25,362 --> 00:55:27,405
So, Mark.

966
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:28,532
Yes.

967
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:32,869
The gardens look lovely.

968
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:34,121
Autumnal.

969
00:55:34,371 --> 00:55:35,371
Yes.

970
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,333
Is that a conker tree?

971
00:55:37,541 --> 00:55:38,876
Bridget.

972
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:45,382
I...

973
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:48,302
Am pregnant.

974
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,014
Right.

975
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:55,016
Congratulations.

976
00:55:56,018 --> 00:55:57,143
How can I help?

977
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:00,563
I'm three months pregnant.

978
00:56:06,028 --> 00:56:07,362
You mean the christening?

979
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:10,949
Right.

980
00:56:14,244 --> 00:56:15,746
Would you excuse me
for just a moment?

981
00:56:39,061 --> 00:56:40,436
I think that this
is quite possibly

982
00:56:40,521 --> 00:56:41,938
the most wonderful
piece of information

983
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:44,817
I have ever
received in my entire life.

984
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:46,652
Oh!

985
00:56:47,653 --> 00:56:49,278
Okay.

986
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:51,072
Of course,
I've got no expectations

987
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:52,407
for how things
should work out.

988
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:54,742
I just thought
you should know.

989
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:55,994
No, of course.

990
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:00,456
I mean, how do you feel?
Are you happy?

991
00:57:00,791 --> 00:57:02,793
Yes, I am.

992
00:57:03,001 --> 00:57:05,963
But so much has happened
in the past 10 years.

993
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:09,340
A lot has changed.
I mean, you've been married,

994
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:14,429
and I've been on a number
of long-haul holidays.

995
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:16,014
But...

996
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:17,432
So here goes on Jack.

997
00:57:17,516 --> 00:57:19,393
And, I mean...
No, I know that.

998
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:22,103
It's just,
right now, I can't quite

999
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:23,688
bring myself to
feel gloomy about it.

1000
00:57:37,327 --> 00:57:40,956
How can I tell him now?

1001
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:47,545
State of emergency,
cannot sleep.

1002
00:57:47,713 --> 00:57:49,213
Looping thoughts
going round and round in head.

1003
00:57:49,715 --> 00:57:52,925
It's surely weird that you can do
something as complicated and important

1004
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:54,635
as growing a baby
or invading Iraq

1005
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:56,179
without any
instruction at all.

1006
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,681
Keep thinking all the alcohol
I've drunk over the years

1007
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:01,226
will give the baby
fetal alcohol syndrome.

1008
00:58:01,393 --> 00:58:02,768
These are
the things I could do.

1009
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:04,730
Tell Mark about Jack,

1010
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:07,231
but risk hurting him so badly,
I couldn't live with myself.

1011
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,942
Not tell Mark about Jack?

1012
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:10,610
But I'd never be able
to go through with it.

1013
00:58:10,777 --> 00:58:12,737
Tell both of them
the other one is the father,

1014
00:58:12,905 --> 00:58:15,364
and then if the one who isn't
the father is upset about it...

1015
00:58:18,202 --> 00:58:21,538
Oh, Christ. Tell no one
and make a run for it.

1016
00:58:22,789 --> 00:58:23,789
Hello?

1017
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:26,126
Hey! It's the father
of your child.

1018
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:28,170
Jack?

1019
00:58:28,253 --> 00:58:29,630
Yeah. Who else?

1020
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:31,882
Come up.

1021
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:33,759
Okay.

1022
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:38,679
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1023
00:58:38,764 --> 00:58:42,976
He's probably employed a team of
Google Earth detectives to find me.

1024
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,978
Okay. Just act naturally.

1025
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:51,777
Hi.

1026
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:52,945
Hi.

1027
00:58:53,445 --> 00:58:54,570
Come in.

1028
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:55,739
Okay.

1029
00:58:58,784 --> 00:59:00,952
You found it.

1030
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:02,746
Try it on. See if it fits.

1031
00:59:06,083 --> 00:59:07,083
Wow.

1032
00:59:09,503 --> 00:59:11,420
I didn't expect to see you.

1033
00:59:11,588 --> 00:59:15,634
I wasn't expecting to come.
I'm not used to being rejected.

1034
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:17,135
Twice.

1035
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:22,266
I hope you've got
cake in that bag.

1036
00:59:29,106 --> 00:59:30,773
I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

1037
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:35,945
Bridget, this whole baby
situation threw me initially.

1038
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:38,824
We squashed an entire
relationship into one night

1039
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:42,202
and skipped straight
to starting-the-family phase.

1040
00:59:42,369 --> 00:59:45,246
We never even had
a real second date.

1041
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:48,166
Just so you know, if we did,

1042
00:59:49,626 --> 00:59:52,128
I would have taken
you to Ottolenghi. Oh.

1043
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:56,173
You would have had the grilled
salmon and pine-nut salsa.

1044
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:59,052
Unbelievable and healthy.
Oh.

1045
00:59:59,219 --> 01:00:04,682
And we would have come back
here, had incredible sex,

1046
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:08,978
spent the next couple days
sending each other filthy texts.

1047
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:23,659
I would not have let you
do that on a second date.

1048
01:00:23,827 --> 01:00:26,538
Why not?
You let me on the first.

1049
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:30,751
And then we'd go on a naughty
weekend to the seaside,

1050
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:35,338
and I would prove my manliness
by winning you a cuddly toy.

1051
01:00:35,422 --> 01:00:37,382
At the pier.

1052
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:39,259
But I really wanted
the giant Scooby-Doo.

1053
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:42,219
Oh, nobody wins those.
Coconuts are glued on.

1054
01:00:51,563 --> 01:00:52,731
What are those for?

1055
01:00:53,106 --> 01:00:54,858
To apologize.

1056
01:00:55,025 --> 01:00:56,610
We had our first fight.

1057
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:59,403
I was not flirting
with that waitress.

1058
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:02,282
She means nothing to me.

1059
01:01:06,954 --> 01:01:07,954
And then,

1060
01:01:09,414 --> 01:01:11,791
I would have bought

1061
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:14,878
Swedish furniture
for us to make.

1062
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:20,217
If we can get through this,
we can get through anything.

1063
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:22,052
Anything.

1064
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:24,054
I'd find it
adorable how your neck

1065
01:01:24,137 --> 01:01:25,429
gets all blotchy
when you get nervous.

1066
01:01:26,431 --> 01:01:30,601
And I know you'd be the greatest
possible mother to my child.

1067
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:03,677
Oh, no.

1068
01:02:03,844 --> 01:02:06,929
Cannot fall in love
with shiny new American.

1069
01:02:07,097 --> 01:02:09,974
I'll tell them both tomorrow.
Definitely.

1070
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:12,853
Hi.

1071
01:02:12,936 --> 01:02:14,228
So, I just wanted
to connect

1072
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:16,273
to check how the
presentation is shaping up.

1073
01:02:16,356 --> 01:02:20,152
Yeah. Totally on top of it.
NutriBullet-ing the shit out of it.

1074
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:21,987
I'm relying on you, Bridget.

1075
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:23,697
I need you to get this right.
Do you understand?

1076
01:02:23,864 --> 01:02:26,532
100*%. You can count on me.

1077
01:02:27,159 --> 01:02:28,201
Great.

1078
01:02:33,123 --> 01:02:34,123
You all right?

1079
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:37,168
I'm fine.

1080
01:02:37,335 --> 01:02:39,170
Big celebration.

1081
01:02:39,463 --> 01:02:41,380
I so glad to see
you back together?

1082
01:02:41,548 --> 01:02:42,715
Certainly is, Gianni.

1083
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:44,050
Wonderful news?

1084
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,554
I was thinking about "Jack. "

1085
01:02:49,347 --> 01:02:51,182
If it's a boy,
after my grandfather.

1086
01:02:51,349 --> 01:02:54,311
It's a good strong name.
You can rely on a Jack.

1087
01:02:54,644 --> 01:02:56,730
Yes. One for the list.

1088
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:58,231
To Jack.
To Jack!

1089
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:02,527
So, this is Dad, I presume.

1090
01:03:02,695 --> 01:03:03,862
So glad you could be here.

1091
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:06,530
This is a unique
and wonderful moment.

1092
01:03:06,699 --> 01:03:07,699
Dr. Rawlings,

1093
01:03:07,824 --> 01:03:11,286
I wonder if you could
maybe do me a little favor?

1094
01:03:13,079 --> 01:03:15,373
So, this is Dad, I presume.

1095
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:18,043
Pleased to meet you.
I'm so glad you could be here.

1096
01:03:18,210 --> 01:03:22,713
This is a unique
and wonderful moment.

1097
01:03:23,173 --> 01:03:25,842
Before we start, would
you like to know the sex?

1098
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:27,177
Maybe we should be prepared.

1099
01:03:27,385 --> 01:03:29,054
You know, I'm not sure.
It's a boy.

1100
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:30,304
Oh.
A boy!

1101
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:31,514
A boy!
A boy!

1102
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:33,141
A boy.
A boy!

1103
01:03:34,893 --> 01:03:36,478
My boy.

1104
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,065
Okay. Right.

1105
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:43,150
This time, I have to tell
them. Will start with Jack.

1106
01:03:43,568 --> 01:03:45,487
Have invited him to big
scary work presentation.

1107
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:48,030
And will explain
all afterwards.

1108
01:03:51,034 --> 01:03:52,369
Welcome.

1109
01:03:52,452 --> 01:03:55,956
In a digital age where
every cell phone is a camera,

1110
01:03:56,039 --> 01:03:57,791
we are all broadcasters.

1111
01:03:58,208 --> 01:04:00,876
Hard News is partnering
with the London Media Show

1112
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:04,130
so that you will be able
to use your smartphones

1113
01:04:04,297 --> 01:04:06,882
to create your own
news broadcasting channels!

1114
01:04:07,425 --> 01:04:10,262
Simply download
the new Hard News app

1115
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:12,722
and broadcast
directly to our studios

1116
01:04:12,889 --> 01:04:18,061
where Miranda is waiting for
our first ever live simulcast.

1117
01:04:18,228 --> 01:04:22,273
And hello, everyone,
live at the London Media Show,

1118
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:27,112
and welcome to the new look of Hard
News studio.

1119
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,614
We are now live!

1120
01:04:29,782 --> 01:04:32,784
And yes,
our viewers are broadcasting.

1121
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:36,288
Right.
Let's now go to the Grampians

1122
01:04:36,454 --> 01:04:40,333
where Adam Wollaston is leading
a team of Venture Rangers

1123
01:04:40,501 --> 01:04:42,501
to the top of Ben Nevis.

1124
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:45,422
Hello, Adam Wollaston!

1125
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:48,132
Hard News sucks balls!

1126
01:04:51,094 --> 01:04:52,094
Jesus!

1127
01:04:52,262 --> 01:04:56,391
Oh, dear. Well, let's put that
news story firmly behind us.

1128
01:05:04,983 --> 01:05:06,818
Technical glitch.

1129
01:05:10,155 --> 01:05:14,492
Of course, it's never been
easier to email or text the show.

1130
01:05:14,659 --> 01:05:16,702
Just search "Hard News,"

1131
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:19,998
or simply, "H."

1132
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:21,291
Because...

1133
01:05:23,126 --> 01:05:25,295
Because...

1134
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:27,797
Holy fuck!
What's he doing here?

1135
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:32,510
Because at Hard News,
we believe...

1136
01:05:34,012 --> 01:05:38,016
We believe that we are ready
and on the frontline,

1137
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:41,644
asking the questions
the world wants answers to.

1138
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:50,362
Turn around.

1139
01:06:01,623 --> 01:06:02,623
Thank you.

1140
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:06,001
Okay.
Career down the toilet.

1141
01:06:06,086 --> 01:06:10,422
Both men in the same room.
What could possibly go wrong?

1142
01:06:14,719 --> 01:06:17,097
I hope you don't mind my just
showing up and surprising you.

1143
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:18,597
No.

1144
01:06:18,682 --> 01:06:20,224
Anyway, well done.
It was very...

1145
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:21,434
Yes.

1146
01:06:21,518 --> 01:06:22,559
Hey.

1147
01:06:23,186 --> 01:06:24,436
...technically adroit.

1148
01:06:25,271 --> 01:06:28,983
Mark, I would love
for you to meet...

1149
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:41,413
Ari Yaratra Sitharamthanthan.

1150
01:06:41,579 --> 01:06:47,085
Ariyaranta is the Area Manager
for DTC Technological Solutions.

1151
01:06:47,585 --> 01:06:50,588
Aren't you, Ari Sinatra?

1152
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:55,802
Hi.
Hello.

1153
01:06:55,885 --> 01:06:56,885
Hey.

1154
01:06:58,931 --> 01:07:00,597
What the hell was that?

1155
01:07:01,057 --> 01:07:02,057
What were you thinking?

1156
01:07:02,309 --> 01:07:05,144
I've got four voice mails from
David Cartwright on my phone

1157
01:07:05,228 --> 01:07:06,896
that I dare not listen to.
I'll be right back.

1158
01:07:07,063 --> 01:07:08,606
You call that
a presentation?

1159
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:10,065
I don't know if I've got
the right people around me

1160
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:11,150
because you're not...

1161
01:07:11,235 --> 01:07:13,027
Alice,
I'm so sorry, but...

1162
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:14,487
Sorry doesn't cut it.
Excuse me.

1163
01:07:14,655 --> 01:07:15,822
Look at me when
I'm talking to you.

1164
01:07:15,947 --> 01:07:16,947
Excuse me?

1165
01:07:17,115 --> 01:07:19,074
I'm so sorry,
but I really...

1166
01:07:20,744 --> 01:07:21,786
What?

1167
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:25,498
Bridget, I'd like you to meet Jack
Quant. He's rather extraordinary.

1168
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:27,916
I was just reading a profile
of him in The New Yorker.

1169
01:07:28,085 --> 01:07:29,960
Right. Yes.
We actually know each other.

1170
01:07:30,128 --> 01:07:31,463
Yes. We certainly do.

1171
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:33,590
Good job. Why didn't you
introduce me to this man before?

1172
01:07:33,757 --> 01:07:36,967
He's brilliant. You know, he represents
the punk-rock band that's being extradited.

1173
01:07:37,135 --> 01:07:38,135
That's right.

1174
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:39,804
Yes, yes. I knew that, too.

1175
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:42,974
Hi. We met
fleetingly before as well.

1176
01:07:43,141 --> 01:07:46,143
I'm in charge of data
management for most of Daventry.

1177
01:07:46,436 --> 01:07:47,436
Oh.

1178
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:48,938
Well...

1179
01:07:49,523 --> 01:07:52,025
I must say it's fantastic
that you're getting on so well

1180
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:53,943
because you have
a lot in common.

1181
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:58,489
Shall we get out of here and
find a place a bit quieter?

1182
01:07:58,657 --> 01:08:00,282
Yes.
Why not? I booked Gianni's.

1183
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:02,534
Great.
That sounds lovely.

1184
01:08:04,621 --> 01:08:08,500
You might have to sit
this one out, Ari...

1185
01:08:08,666 --> 01:08:09,833
I'm sorry.

1186
01:08:16,007 --> 01:08:18,551
So, do you actually
believe that mathematics can...

1187
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:20,302
How did you put it
in your book?

1188
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:23,180
"Help us analyze behavior
previously invisible to science"?

1189
01:08:23,681 --> 01:08:25,600
Well, my dating
algorithm is to help people

1190
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:27,685
find love,
not necessarily replace it.

1191
01:08:28,186 --> 01:08:30,188
Oh, no. Is incredible idea.

1192
01:08:30,355 --> 01:08:32,856
Have you ever tried it out?

1193
01:08:34,693 --> 01:08:36,069
You're single, right?

1194
01:08:36,862 --> 01:08:38,363
Well, I'm...

1195
01:08:38,530 --> 01:08:40,239
Yes, I suppose so.

1196
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:42,574
And how did you two meet?

1197
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:46,371
Oh.

1198
01:08:47,122 --> 01:08:48,122
Yeah.

1199
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:50,500
It's...

1200
01:08:52,377 --> 01:08:55,712
It's sort of a funny story.
Sort of.

1201
01:08:59,676 --> 01:09:02,261
You see, a few months ago,
on the fourth of the month,

1202
01:09:02,429 --> 01:09:04,721
I met Jack at
a music festival.

1203
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:05,849
Right.

1204
01:09:06,015 --> 01:09:08,016
And we got on very well.

1205
01:09:08,185 --> 01:09:11,854
And sort of
had, relations.

1206
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:16,192
And the next week, that is to
say, on the 11 th of the month

1207
01:09:16,359 --> 01:09:18,528
at Jude's baby christening
to be exact,

1208
01:09:18,695 --> 01:09:20,904
Following the consumption
of quite a lot of alcohol,

1209
01:09:21,073 --> 01:09:24,158
Mark and I, well,
we had similar relations?

1210
01:09:25,911 --> 01:09:28,912
And this is
the funny part, I suppose.

1211
01:09:29,081 --> 01:09:31,457
Owing to these relations,

1212
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:34,127
the resulting life form
currently residing in my tummy

1213
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:37,296
could actually,
in fact, be either of yours.

1214
01:09:46,556 --> 01:09:48,891
I know I should have
told you both before.

1215
01:09:51,228 --> 01:09:52,936
But I just didn't.

1216
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:56,274
You both seemed so happy.

1217
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:58,109
So, correct me if I'm wrong,

1218
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:00,444
but did you just say that the
baby could be either of ours?

1219
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:08,703
So, you have no idea which
of us is actually the father?

1220
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:14,458
I know,
it's all very confusing.

1221
01:10:16,127 --> 01:10:17,170
I'm sorry.

1222
01:10:17,253 --> 01:10:18,253
I'm sorry.

1223
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:23,635
So, however we choose,
to do this,

1224
01:10:27,472 --> 01:10:29,640
the most important
thing now is this.

1225
01:10:29,807 --> 01:10:31,059
Is this.

1226
01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:36,939
Okay, Bridget, I'm not gonna
pretend this isn't a shock.

1227
01:10:38,984 --> 01:10:42,779
But I want you to know, whatever
the circumstance, you're right.

1228
01:10:43,988 --> 01:10:46,073
The most important
thing is the baby.

1229
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:49,368
Who knows, this could
be a great adventure.

1230
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:53,581
I'm afraid you're going to have
to excuse me. I have a meeting.

1231
01:10:59,171 --> 01:11:00,212
I'm sorry.

1232
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:01,506
Mark.

1233
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:10,222
Gianni, can we have
the bill, please?

1234
01:11:20,275 --> 01:11:21,943
And if I thought
that was tricky,

1235
01:11:22,027 --> 01:11:23,819
how would
the news go down at Mum's

1236
01:11:23,904 --> 01:11:25,654
parish council
election campaign?

1237
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:29,199
Honestly, we started half an
hour ago. Where have you been?

1238
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:30,702
You said it was an emergency?

1239
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:32,787
Well, The Gazette wants
to take a family portrait.

1240
01:11:32,871 --> 01:11:33,871
What are you wearing?

1241
01:11:36,207 --> 01:11:37,542
Oh, my God.
Bridget, are you...

1242
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:38,876
Yep.

1243
01:11:39,502 --> 01:11:40,586
Oh!
Yeah.

1244
01:11:41,255 --> 01:11:43,088
Why didn't you say anything?

1245
01:11:44,382 --> 01:11:45,757
Well,
didn't want to upset you.

1246
01:11:45,926 --> 01:11:47,510
Well, why would you?

1247
01:11:48,386 --> 01:11:49,554
Oh, no, Bridget.

1248
01:11:49,721 --> 01:11:50,846
Who's the father?

1249
01:11:51,515 --> 01:11:53,557
It's not Mark, is it?
Oh, do say it is.

1250
01:11:53,725 --> 01:11:55,600
Well, there's
at least a 50*% chance.

1251
01:11:55,769 --> 01:11:57,228
"A 50*% chance"?

1252
01:11:57,395 --> 01:11:59,604
Mark or this really
nice American called Jack.

1253
01:11:59,773 --> 01:12:03,568
No, Bridget. An American?
Did you have a three-way?

1254
01:12:04,778 --> 01:12:06,029
Mrs. Jones.

1255
01:12:07,948 --> 01:12:11,283
Here, take this and
pretend everything's fine.

1256
01:12:11,409 --> 01:12:12,409
Everything is fine.

1257
01:12:12,744 --> 01:12:14,244
Mrs. Jones. Can we...

1258
01:12:14,662 --> 01:12:16,747
Look, here's a lovely
place for you to stand.

1259
01:12:20,918 --> 01:12:21,961
Are you ashamed of me?

1260
01:12:22,087 --> 01:12:24,630
No, darling.
It's just the circumstances.

1261
01:12:24,797 --> 01:12:27,716
I'm running for
high office, you see.

1262
01:12:30,636 --> 01:12:31,762
So long.

1263
01:12:32,430 --> 01:12:34,890
It's not the 1950s.

1264
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:36,559
Look around you.

1265
01:12:36,643 --> 01:12:40,313
Two lesbians have
just adopted at number 32.

1266
01:12:41,105 --> 01:12:42,689
If you don't change
the way you look at things,

1267
01:12:42,774 --> 01:12:44,942
you're going to lose
your precious election,

1268
01:12:45,652 --> 01:12:47,569
and perhaps your daughter.

1269
01:12:50,282 --> 01:12:53,076
Bridget, so lovely
to see you. Are you...

1270
01:12:53,243 --> 01:12:55,243
Yes. I am.

1271
01:12:55,412 --> 01:12:59,247
How wonderful. We thought
you'd just got all fat again.

1272
01:13:03,002 --> 01:13:05,128
I'm now the Mary
Magdalene of Middle England.

1273
01:13:05,421 --> 01:13:07,798
Have alienated
Mum and Mark Darcy.

1274
01:13:08,091 --> 01:13:09,801
Am like tropical female insect

1275
01:13:09,967 --> 01:13:12,095
that shags men to impregnate
self, then eats them.

1276
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:13,554
The question is,

1277
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:16,974
will Mark even turn up and
engage in our polyamorous family?

1278
01:13:24,983 --> 01:13:25,983
Hey!

1279
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:27,068
Hello!

1280
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:29,319
First prenatal class.

1281
01:13:30,488 --> 01:13:31,613
Exciting?

1282
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:32,823
Yeah!

1283
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:34,367
Wow.

1284
01:13:34,993 --> 01:13:36,577
You look great.

1285
01:13:43,335 --> 01:13:44,627
Hello.
Hello!

1286
01:13:46,046 --> 01:13:47,712
Oh, I'm so glad you came.

1287
01:13:47,881 --> 01:13:49,340
Yeah, me, too.

1288
01:13:49,507 --> 01:13:51,384
Brought you an iced tea.
Oh, well!

1289
01:13:51,551 --> 01:13:52,676
Thank you.

1290
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:56,471
It's awesome
to see you, man.

1291
01:13:57,015 --> 01:13:59,516
But there's a heck of a lot
of caffeine in that tea.

1292
01:13:59,725 --> 01:14:03,020
I brought you
a super juice.

1293
01:14:03,104 --> 01:14:04,104
Oh!

1294
01:14:04,314 --> 01:14:05,314
Thank you!

1295
01:14:07,693 --> 01:14:08,859
Shall we go in?

1296
01:14:09,027 --> 01:14:11,154
Why not? Sure. Let
me carry that for you.

1297
01:14:11,238 --> 01:14:12,529
Oh. Thank you.

1298
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:14,532
Can I carry
your phone for you?

1299
01:14:15,242 --> 01:14:16,742
Okay.

1300
01:14:18,744 --> 01:14:19,871
Thank you.

1301
01:14:20,913 --> 01:14:23,039
And who do we have here then?

1302
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:27,336
I'm Bridget
and this is Jack.

1303
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,547
And this is Mark.

1304
01:14:31,466 --> 01:14:33,634
Oh!

1305
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:34,926
Lovely.

1306
01:14:35,136 --> 01:14:37,512
You're our second
same-sex couple today!

1307
01:14:41,185 --> 01:14:42,726
No, actually, we're...

1308
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:44,020
Absolutely!

1309
01:14:44,104 --> 01:14:47,648
We just need the gift of a
baby to make us feel complete.

1310
01:14:48,233 --> 01:14:49,442
You must be the surrogate?

1311
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:51,652
Exactly. Yes.

1312
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:55,072
Just helping this wonderful
couple make their dream come true.

1313
01:14:55,239 --> 01:14:56,948
See, Mark is very nervous
about all this.

1314
01:14:57,117 --> 01:14:59,577
It's all new to you,
isn't it, lamb chop?

1315
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:05,625
Like all visionaries,
we'll encounter bumps along the road.

1316
01:15:05,917 --> 01:15:08,586
How would you like to give
birth to your placenta?

1317
01:15:08,753 --> 01:15:09,921
Quickly!

1318
01:15:34,904 --> 01:15:36,447
Are you okay?
Are you sure?

1319
01:15:37,114 --> 01:15:38,658
And of course,
massage can have

1320
01:15:38,742 --> 01:15:40,826
many benefits
throughout pregnancy.

1321
01:15:40,993 --> 01:15:42,161
Can we name some of them?

1322
01:15:42,328 --> 01:15:45,122
Yes. It relieves stress and
promotes feel-good hormones.

1323
01:15:45,289 --> 01:15:47,332
And is also to be avoided in
cases of high-risk pregnancy.

1324
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:49,627
For example, when there
is a geriatric mother.

1325
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:52,837
Right! Excellent.
Someone's been reading up.

1326
01:15:53,006 --> 01:15:54,131
Would you like to have a go?

1327
01:15:54,298 --> 01:15:56,007
No, I think I'll let
Jack get on with it.

1328
01:15:56,092 --> 01:15:57,760
I think he seems
to have it covered.

1329
01:15:57,927 --> 01:16:01,180
That's very sweet of you. That's
why I love you, my little teacup.

1330
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:05,518
What
if we asked the right question

1331
01:16:05,601 --> 01:16:07,310
and applied
the laws of mathematics

1332
01:16:07,479 --> 01:16:09,771
so that the science of
courtship could be quantified?

1333
01:16:33,046 --> 01:16:34,255
Yippee!

1334
01:16:34,338 --> 01:16:35,547
It's a match!

1335
01:17:07,372 --> 01:17:09,081
May I please
make an application

1336
01:17:09,166 --> 01:17:10,832
for leave to
appeal in the case of

1337
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:14,045
Her Majesty's Government and
Saddiq Al Bashir.

1338
01:17:14,921 --> 01:17:17,840
As Your Lordship is no doubt
aware, Mr. Al Bashir lost...

1339
01:17:18,216 --> 01:17:19,507
So, everything's
all right?

1340
01:17:19,676 --> 01:17:22,052
Yes, well,
it's this combination.

1341
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:26,681
Gherkins, anchovies,
banana juice, and Pringles!

1342
01:17:27,225 --> 01:17:28,975
So, essentially...

1343
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:30,060
It's wind.

1344
01:17:31,896 --> 01:17:34,398
Right. So, going forward,

1345
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:38,109
regular Pringles,
not hot spicy barbecue?

1346
01:17:38,278 --> 01:17:40,112
Or possibly
no Pringles at all.

1347
01:17:40,279 --> 01:17:41,404
Try that.

1348
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:47,036
Is everything all right?
Is Bridget okay?

1349
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:48,578
Yes. Perfectly fine.

1350
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:49,829
She in there with...

1351
01:17:49,914 --> 01:17:51,748
That's Dr. Pringle.

1352
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:53,751
He's testing her blood.
This is interesting.

1353
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:56,753
This is a new bedside technique
we're testing out of Oslo.

1354
01:17:56,921 --> 01:17:58,005
It's Norwegian...

1355
01:17:58,090 --> 01:17:59,881
It's all right. I know about
Jack. Thank you, Doctor.

1356
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:02,510
Oh, thank goodness. Why
didn't you tell me? She's fine.

1357
01:18:02,677 --> 01:18:04,886
He's calmed her down
completely actually.

1358
01:18:05,096 --> 01:18:07,472
I'm sorry. I got your
messages. I was in court.

1359
01:18:07,556 --> 01:18:08,556
Oh.

1360
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:11,185
Oh.

1361
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:14,479
Hi. It's all right.
Can't be helped.

1362
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:20,277
You should get it.

1363
01:18:20,444 --> 01:18:22,113
It might be work.

1364
01:18:25,033 --> 01:18:26,742
Don't worry. I got it covered.

1365
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:28,411
Yes, I can see that!

1366
01:18:29,328 --> 01:18:32,038
Wow. Okay.
You need to chill out.

1367
01:18:32,707 --> 01:18:34,291
We have to do this together.

1368
01:18:34,917 --> 01:18:37,377
You know, in Peru, the Um.
Bat Do consider paternity

1369
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:39,296
a task shared
between the many tribesmen.

1370
01:18:39,463 --> 01:18:41,631
Well, unfortunately,
we Um Bat Don't live in Peru.

1371
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,175
I live in Ealing.

1372
01:18:44,301 --> 01:18:47,137
Negative energy is
just so bad for the baby.

1373
01:18:49,932 --> 01:18:52,475
Stop it, both of you!

1374
01:18:52,810 --> 01:18:54,811
This isn't a competition.

1375
01:18:56,814 --> 01:18:58,649
She's right.

1376
01:18:58,899 --> 01:19:01,902
We should take this toxic
energy out of the room.

1377
01:19:09,994 --> 01:19:11,619
I won't be a minute.

1378
01:19:23,841 --> 01:19:25,259
What's up?

1379
01:19:25,342 --> 01:19:26,594
Come on, buddy.

1380
01:19:27,762 --> 01:19:28,804
Why are you so angry?

1381
01:19:30,431 --> 01:19:32,307
You know what?
I'm really not your buddy.

1382
01:19:32,475 --> 01:19:35,853
And I don't know about vibes or
negative energy or prenatal wind

1383
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:37,479
and even less
about algorithms.

1384
01:19:37,646 --> 01:19:40,524
So, I will confess that the laws of
attraction are somewhat beyond me.

1385
01:19:41,275 --> 01:19:44,028
In fact, Bridget defies
comprehension generally.

1386
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:45,820
But despite,
or perhaps, owing to

1387
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:47,323
the bewildering
litany of catastrophes

1388
01:19:47,407 --> 01:19:48,740
I've witnessed over
the last 40 years,

1389
01:19:48,824 --> 01:19:50,117
I feel I've come to
know Bridget rather well,

1390
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:52,328
and I've spent those years
caring for her very deeply.

1391
01:19:52,496 --> 01:19:53,912
And that may defy
automated reasoning,

1392
01:19:53,997 --> 01:19:55,331
but there's nothing
I can do about it.

1393
01:19:55,498 --> 01:19:56,748
Nothing you can do about it?

1394
01:19:56,832 --> 01:19:58,208
Maybe you should try
and stay around a little

1395
01:19:58,292 --> 01:20:00,127
instead of saving
the world by cell phone.

1396
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:01,377
I make her happy, Mark.

1397
01:20:01,546 --> 01:20:03,130
And I suppose your
algorithm tells you

1398
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:04,715
you're destined to
be together, does it?

1399
01:20:04,882 --> 01:20:06,132
Actually, it does.

1400
01:20:06,217 --> 01:20:08,385
The fact that you've been trying
and failing for the past 10 years

1401
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:09,470
tells me you are not.

1402
01:20:09,970 --> 01:20:11,012
No.

1403
01:20:11,096 --> 01:20:12,555
I don't want to
fight with you.

1404
01:20:15,894 --> 01:20:17,560
We should think about
Bridget and the baby.

1405
01:20:18,188 --> 01:20:19,979
For better or worse,
fate has brought us together.

1406
01:20:20,064 --> 01:20:22,233
It wasn't fate,
it was condoms.

1407
01:20:23,025 --> 01:20:24,025
What do you mean?

1408
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:25,528
Those ridiculous
dolphin-friendly things

1409
01:20:25,612 --> 01:20:27,238
from the bottom
of Bridget's bag.

1410
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:30,198
I'm sorry, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1411
01:20:30,367 --> 01:20:31,826
When Bridget and I
got it on,

1412
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:34,828
I was not dressed
for the occasion.

1413
01:21:18,038 --> 01:21:19,456
No Mark today?

1414
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:20,582
No.

1415
01:21:25,755 --> 01:21:27,672
We must thank one person

1416
01:21:27,756 --> 01:21:30,259
who was prepared to fight
for us when no one else would.

1417
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:33,845
And we say to that
person with all our heart...

1418
01:21:37,975 --> 01:21:39,475
Free speech!

1419
01:21:43,939 --> 01:21:45,815
Bridget. Camera back.

1420
01:21:47,652 --> 01:21:51,070
I still can't believe
Mark ducked out like that.

1421
01:21:51,405 --> 01:21:53,157
Well,
it's not really his fault.

1422
01:21:53,574 --> 01:21:58,119
I suppose we just have to
hope it's Jack's, right?

1423
01:21:59,163 --> 01:22:00,622
I mean, let's face it.

1424
01:22:00,789 --> 01:22:04,001
Things could be worse.
He is pretty fucking amazing.

1425
01:22:04,168 --> 01:22:07,253
He's richer than God, and he
has a very nice-sized puppet.

1426
01:22:07,421 --> 01:22:08,838
He does.

1427
01:22:09,423 --> 01:22:12,176
And we match up
very nicely on paper.

1428
01:22:13,345 --> 01:22:14,636
How do you know?

1429
01:22:15,137 --> 01:22:16,512
You just have to have faith.

1430
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:18,181
You just have to
ask yourself,

1431
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:23,270
"Can I see myself
growing old with this guy

1432
01:22:23,979 --> 01:22:25,814
"and not Mark Darcy?"

1433
01:22:28,359 --> 01:22:30,985
There it is.
There we go.

1434
01:22:38,662 --> 01:22:40,703
Oh, hey!
Oh.

1435
01:22:41,038 --> 01:22:44,123
You know, first few months,
they only see black and white.

1436
01:22:44,208 --> 01:22:46,542
This will help
stimulate spatial awareness.

1437
01:22:47,045 --> 01:22:49,212
Or early onset
motion sickness.

1438
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:53,550
I got him one of these.
A bouncy chair.

1439
01:22:55,845 --> 01:22:58,721
Not quite sure where
we're going to put it.

1440
01:22:59,015 --> 01:23:00,015
Yeah.

1441
01:23:00,182 --> 01:23:01,182
About that,

1442
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:05,895
it's kind of cramped
in here, don't you think?

1443
01:23:08,399 --> 01:23:09,649
It's cozy.

1444
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:13,904
You know,
I've been thinking...

1445
01:23:14,989 --> 01:23:17,533
Might be nice if
we moved in together.

1446
01:23:18,243 --> 01:23:20,411
You think
we're ready for that?

1447
01:23:20,578 --> 01:23:24,081
I'm just tired of living in
hotel rooms and airport lounges.

1448
01:23:25,332 --> 01:23:26,750
We could be a family.

1449
01:23:27,877 --> 01:23:30,045
Me, you and him.

1450
01:23:31,338 --> 01:23:32,672
What do you say?

1451
01:23:38,387 --> 01:23:39,762
What if it's not yours?

1452
01:23:40,347 --> 01:23:41,431
What?

1453
01:23:41,515 --> 01:23:44,059
What if the baby
turns out to be Mark's?

1454
01:23:49,356 --> 01:23:52,067
Well, I mean, it would
certainly change things.

1455
01:23:56,948 --> 01:23:59,365
Is that what you want?
For it to be Mark's?

1456
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:07,332
Are you in love with him?

1457
01:24:10,753 --> 01:24:12,546
I have been.

1458
01:24:12,713 --> 01:24:14,172
In the past.

1459
01:24:16,592 --> 01:24:17,926
And me?

1460
01:24:20,345 --> 01:24:23,474
I could be one day.

1461
01:24:31,983 --> 01:24:35,485
Bridget, I haven't been
entirely honest with you.

1462
01:24:37,113 --> 01:24:38,529
Mark thinks
the baby isn't his,

1463
01:24:38,614 --> 01:24:40,908
and I let him
believe it was mine.

1464
01:24:41,576 --> 01:24:43,786
That's why he disappeared.

1465
01:24:47,707 --> 01:24:48,791
Why would he think that?

1466
01:24:48,957 --> 01:24:52,543
Because I let him. Because
I wanted you for myself.

1467
01:24:54,255 --> 01:24:55,255
Oh.

1468
01:24:56,131 --> 01:24:58,509
We could be so good
for each other.

1469
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:02,345
97*%.

1470
01:25:04,724 --> 01:25:06,307
On paper.

1471
01:25:07,018 --> 01:25:09,310
But falling in love
doesn't happen on paper.

1472
01:25:11,564 --> 01:25:13,439
Sometimes you love a person

1473
01:25:13,608 --> 01:25:16,859
because of all the reasons
they're not like you.

1474
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:20,988
And sometimes
you love a person

1475
01:25:21,073 --> 01:25:23,867
just because
they feel like home.

1476
01:25:27,872 --> 01:25:29,789
I've got to find Mark.

1477
01:25:36,338 --> 01:25:39,341
Hello, Pierce.
It's Bridget.

1478
01:25:39,509 --> 01:25:40,676
I'm trying to
get hold of Mark.

1479
01:25:40,844 --> 01:25:42,511
Hejust got back
from a trip, Bridget.

1480
01:25:42,595 --> 01:25:44,470
He's in a taxi
on his way home.

1481
01:26:18,922 --> 01:26:19,922
Hi.

1482
01:27:04,969 --> 01:27:07,804
Approximately
eight weeks to go.

1483
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:15,604
You don't really
need them, you know.

1484
01:27:15,688 --> 01:27:18,064
All they're good for is fitting
car seats and blaming things on.

1485
01:27:18,149 --> 01:27:20,359
They really just get
in the way after that.

1486
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:24,654
You're absolutely capable
of doing this on your own.

1487
01:27:26,490 --> 01:27:27,532
I did.

1488
01:27:46,636 --> 01:27:49,930
You know what?
I can do this on my own.

1489
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:52,306
We can do this on our own.

1490
01:27:52,850 --> 01:27:54,184
One of the perks
of being pregnant

1491
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:57,061
is no longer feel like
a tragic, lonely spinster

1492
01:27:57,229 --> 01:27:59,814
because of miniature
miracle growing inside.

1493
01:28:00,315 --> 01:28:01,315
Hello.

1494
01:28:01,567 --> 01:28:02,818
Hello!

1495
01:28:04,988 --> 01:28:08,323
Mum's throwing a Christmas
party/political rally.

1496
01:28:08,490 --> 01:28:10,701
It's like the G8
summit with Scotch eggs.

1497
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:13,828
Oh.
Be brave. Go in.

1498
01:28:14,497 --> 01:28:16,163
Hello, darling!
Hello.

1499
01:28:16,332 --> 01:28:20,002
Sorry, I didn't realize everyone
was here. I'll just pop upstairs.

1500
01:28:20,168 --> 01:28:23,337
No, nonsense. Nonsense.

1501
01:28:23,881 --> 01:28:26,591
Una's had all
the posters re-printed.

1502
01:28:27,426 --> 01:28:28,926
Oh.
You've inspired me.

1503
01:28:29,011 --> 01:28:30,636
It's still so long.

1504
01:28:30,721 --> 01:28:32,722
You were quite right,
as it turns out.

1505
01:28:32,890 --> 01:28:35,309
This place is teeming with
single mothers, single fathers,

1506
01:28:35,393 --> 01:28:37,476
bisexuals, surrogates,

1507
01:28:37,645 --> 01:28:38,729
and they're all lovely.

1508
01:28:38,895 --> 01:28:40,188
And so normal.

1509
01:28:40,355 --> 01:28:42,356
Do you know, I've even got
two homosexuals on the team?

1510
01:28:42,524 --> 01:28:43,524
No, thank you.

1511
01:28:43,693 --> 01:28:45,527
Who knew?
Everybody.

1512
01:28:47,447 --> 01:28:49,613
I'm so proud of you,
darling, you know that?

1513
01:28:50,073 --> 01:28:51,240
What you're doing is not easy.

1514
01:28:51,408 --> 01:28:53,243
But if anyone can
make it work, it's you.

1515
01:28:54,244 --> 01:28:58,164
That child is the luckiest boy
on earth to have you as his mum.

1516
01:28:58,332 --> 01:28:59,332
And he's going
to have the love

1517
01:28:59,417 --> 01:29:01,835
of a million fathers
with you by his side.

1518
01:29:02,045 --> 01:29:03,045
Oh...

1519
01:29:03,503 --> 01:29:06,131
Come on. We've got
some campaigning to do.

1520
01:29:06,423 --> 01:29:10,010
Make way, make way. Single
pregnant mother coming through.

1521
01:29:11,845 --> 01:29:13,764
Laura, Josh.

1522
01:29:14,056 --> 01:29:17,725
We need to give six minutes
to General Lu Tong, okay?

1523
01:29:17,894 --> 01:29:19,519
It's a huge scoop.

1524
01:29:19,686 --> 01:29:21,563
Yeah. Alice wants to
pull the interview. What?

1525
01:29:21,646 --> 01:29:24,858
She's got a feature on "Is the
world really ending on Tuesday?"

1526
01:29:25,068 --> 01:29:28,403
Well, it may as well if we
lose Lu Tong. Lu Tong stays.

1527
01:29:28,570 --> 01:29:30,988
Six minutes.
Let's do this.

1528
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:34,618
General Lu Tong. Hi!

1529
01:29:34,786 --> 01:29:38,537
Sorry it's so chaotic in here
today. Thank you for coming on.

1530
01:29:38,706 --> 01:29:40,791
We're on live in two minutes.

1531
01:29:40,957 --> 01:29:42,792
Miranda will
probably want to start

1532
01:29:42,877 --> 01:29:45,462
with what's going
on in Naypyidaw.

1533
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:47,838
Miranda,
get back on General Lu Tong.

1534
01:29:47,965 --> 01:29:48,965
Keep pressing.

1535
01:29:49,466 --> 01:29:52,260
So, let me ask you one
more time, General Lu Tong,

1536
01:29:52,427 --> 01:29:55,514
will you take responsibility
for the human rights abuses

1537
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:57,556
perpetrated by
your own government?

1538
01:29:57,725 --> 01:30:00,560
He's on the rack. Tight on
four. Get those beads of sweat.

1539
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:01,645
In you go,
four, push in.

1540
01:30:01,770 --> 01:30:04,398
I'm sorry.
I can't answer that.

1541
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:06,983
Can't or won't, Lu Tong?

1542
01:30:07,150 --> 01:30:09,152
Can't or won't,
General Lu Tong?

1543
01:30:09,319 --> 01:30:11,695
On balance
I'd suggest "can't"

1544
01:30:11,863 --> 01:30:14,949
considering I've just found
General Lu Tong in the lobby

1545
01:30:15,118 --> 01:30:16,952
and his chauffeur is
currently live on-air

1546
01:30:17,119 --> 01:30:19,787
answering questions about
Far Eastern geopolitics.

1547
01:30:19,956 --> 01:30:21,832
No?
Any comment you want to make

1548
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:24,835
about the use of sexual
torture by your own military?

1549
01:30:26,503 --> 01:30:28,755
Ask him about London traffic.

1550
01:30:28,922 --> 01:30:32,007
London traffic, General Lu
Tong? Anything to say about that?

1551
01:30:32,426 --> 01:30:33,844
No comment there.

1552
01:30:34,011 --> 01:30:35,095
Unbelievable.

1553
01:30:35,262 --> 01:30:36,762
That's it from
General Lu Tong.

1554
01:30:36,847 --> 01:30:38,722
We'll see you
after this short break.

1555
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:39,850
Good job!

1556
01:30:43,645 --> 01:30:46,273
Unfortunately,
you leave me no choice.

1557
01:30:46,356 --> 01:30:49,818
It's actually illegal to fire
somebody for being pregnant.

1558
01:30:49,985 --> 01:30:51,110
I'm not firing her
for being pregnant.

1559
01:30:51,194 --> 01:30:52,612
I'm firing her for
gross incompetency.

1560
01:30:52,697 --> 01:30:55,030
Bridget is the
beating heart of this show.

1561
01:30:55,158 --> 01:30:56,615
How could you
want to fire her?

1562
01:30:56,783 --> 01:30:59,453
How about for interviewing a
chauffeur instead of a general?

1563
01:30:59,619 --> 01:31:00,912
Using a TV interview

1564
01:31:01,079 --> 01:31:03,622
to determine if a guest might
be the father of her child

1565
01:31:03,791 --> 01:31:08,420
and being responsible for the
broadcast of six bare arses?

1566
01:31:14,176 --> 01:31:15,301
It's okay.

1567
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:17,720
It's really okay, Richard.

1568
01:31:18,221 --> 01:31:21,349
I was going to quit anyway.
Probably.

1569
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:26,729
Believe it or not, I was a little
like you when I started here.

1570
01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:29,190
A little chunkier,
much less make-up.

1571
01:31:29,817 --> 01:31:31,400
But I wanted to
make my mark, too.

1572
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:34,654
But I don't want to be
part of your rebranding.

1573
01:31:34,822 --> 01:31:36,573
I haven't got
the right haircut anyway,

1574
01:31:36,740 --> 01:31:38,492
and I don't drink
cocktails out of jam jars

1575
01:31:38,576 --> 01:31:40,827
or post photos of
my lunch on Instagram.

1576
01:31:41,119 --> 01:31:43,579
And I suppose
it's become unfashionable

1577
01:31:43,747 --> 01:31:46,166
to care about wanting
to make something worthwhile.

1578
01:31:46,333 --> 01:31:50,295
But I would rather be
old-fashioned and unemployed

1579
01:31:50,462 --> 01:31:53,172
than part of a show
that celebrates the inane.

1580
01:31:54,007 --> 01:31:56,551
Then maybe when my boy
is old enough to understand,

1581
01:31:56,636 --> 01:31:59,095
integrity will be
fashionable again.

1582
01:32:27,792 --> 01:32:29,458
What have I done?

1583
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:41,680
Oh.

1584
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:46,225
It's all very well
fighting for your principles

1585
01:32:46,310 --> 01:32:48,686
when there's no food
in the fridge.

1586
01:32:53,859 --> 01:32:56,944
I mean, how difficult
can it be to find another job

1587
01:32:57,113 --> 01:33:01,323
when you've just been fired
and you're nine months pregnant?

1588
01:33:01,492 --> 01:33:03,158
And whatever happens now,

1589
01:33:03,327 --> 01:33:06,496
I'm going to get you
one of those bloody Bugaboos.

1590
01:33:09,625 --> 01:33:11,501
Birthday?

1591
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:16,463
Oh, God.
Brain's gone to mush.

1592
01:33:16,631 --> 01:33:18,091
First shag?

1593
01:33:22,721 --> 01:33:23,846
No!

1594
01:33:26,725 --> 01:33:28,184
Bugger!

1595
01:33:33,149 --> 01:33:35,149
I'm really sorry.

1596
01:33:37,819 --> 01:33:40,613
I've gone all crap
all of a sudden.

1597
01:33:41,948 --> 01:33:42,990
Right.

1598
01:33:54,045 --> 01:33:55,628
No, no, no.

1599
01:33:58,716 --> 01:33:59,923
Oh, fuck.

1600
01:34:29,997 --> 01:34:31,789
Bugger, bugger, bugger.

1601
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:35,561
Okay.
New pre-birth resolutions.

1602
01:35:35,729 --> 01:35:40,483
I, Bridget Jones, am going to
be the best mother in the world.

1603
01:35:41,193 --> 01:35:43,528
I'm going to try not
to leave you in a shop

1604
01:35:43,695 --> 01:35:44,904
or put you in
the washing machine

1605
01:35:44,988 --> 01:35:48,073
like that woman in
the newspaper with her cat.

1606
01:35:48,617 --> 01:35:50,952
Look,
I know I made you a promise

1607
01:35:51,119 --> 01:35:53,872
I would get things sorted
before you got here.

1608
01:35:54,038 --> 01:35:56,541
Well, the truth is, I haven't.

1609
01:35:56,708 --> 01:35:59,127
But you and me
can do this together

1610
01:36:00,212 --> 01:36:03,881
because knights in shining
armor don't exist anymore.

1611
01:36:04,759 --> 01:36:07,801
Or do they?

1612
01:36:23,152 --> 01:36:24,152
Hi.

1613
01:36:26,154 --> 01:36:27,154
Bridget.

1614
01:36:27,489 --> 01:36:28,907
Good God,
what are you doing there?

1615
01:36:29,073 --> 01:36:30,158
You're all wet.

1616
01:36:30,326 --> 01:36:31,326
Yes.

1617
01:36:31,452 --> 01:36:33,243
I locked myself out.

1618
01:36:33,412 --> 01:36:37,832
I left my bag,
lost my keys, phone,

1619
01:36:39,376 --> 01:36:40,793
my mind.

1620
01:36:41,337 --> 01:36:43,337
What are you doing here?

1621
01:36:44,881 --> 01:36:48,842
Well, it seems I can always
find time to save the world.

1622
01:36:49,011 --> 01:36:50,761
But you're my world.

1623
01:36:58,145 --> 01:37:00,729
I thought you were
back with Candida.

1624
01:37:01,524 --> 01:37:03,690
You know perfectly
well her name is Camilla.

1625
01:37:04,234 --> 01:37:05,359
Camilla.

1626
01:37:07,654 --> 01:37:12,242
I came round your house to
find you and she was there.

1627
01:37:12,493 --> 01:37:15,619
She came to collect her bags.
Gone back to The Hague.

1628
01:37:16,162 --> 01:37:18,706
I've just taken
her to the airport.

1629
01:37:36,934 --> 01:37:38,268
Thank you.

1630
01:37:41,771 --> 01:37:42,771
Bridget,

1631
01:37:44,483 --> 01:37:49,237
you know I find emotional
declarations difficult.

1632
01:37:51,614 --> 01:37:53,490
But the truth is...

1633
01:37:59,163 --> 01:38:00,789
Why are my trousers warm?

1634
01:38:04,295 --> 01:38:05,502
My waters must have broken!

1635
01:38:05,753 --> 01:38:06,712
Oh, Jesus.

1636
01:38:06,796 --> 01:38:08,922
So sorry. I'll get a cloth.

1637
01:38:09,007 --> 01:38:11,175
But you're not due for another
two or three weeks at least.

1638
01:38:12,136 --> 01:38:13,344
Oh. That's a contraction.

1639
01:38:13,511 --> 01:38:15,012
I think we should get
to the hospital quickly.

1640
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:16,180
Absolutely.

1641
01:38:16,306 --> 01:38:17,599
Let's take your car.

1642
01:38:17,765 --> 01:38:18,975
I came in a taxi.

1643
01:38:19,143 --> 01:38:20,393
Oh, for fuck's sake.

1644
01:38:20,476 --> 01:38:21,853
Well, how was I
supposed to know?

1645
01:38:22,145 --> 01:38:23,479
No, not you. The contractions!

1646
01:38:23,646 --> 01:38:24,646
No, we'll take your car.

1647
01:38:24,731 --> 01:38:25,731
We can't!

1648
01:38:25,815 --> 01:38:28,443
The car keys are in my bag
with everything else.

1649
01:38:28,527 --> 01:38:29,527
Oh!

1650
01:38:29,819 --> 01:38:31,362
Five, six, seven, eight.

1651
01:38:31,447 --> 01:38:33,655
You just pant and
breathe and count.

1652
01:38:33,823 --> 01:38:35,617
Nine. That's what you're
supposed to do, isn't it?

1653
01:38:35,783 --> 01:38:37,327
Ten...

1654
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:44,792
You should get that.

1655
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:46,668
It might be work.

1656
01:38:48,463 --> 01:38:49,463
No! Don't!

1657
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:50,840
Oi!

1658
01:38:52,342 --> 01:38:53,384
What the fuck?

1659
01:38:53,510 --> 01:38:54,844
That's really sweet.

1660
01:38:56,137 --> 01:38:57,805
But we've got to call a cab.

1661
01:38:58,222 --> 01:38:59,515
Oh, shit.

1662
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:01,184
Right. What do we do?

1663
01:39:03,854 --> 01:39:05,313
I'll think of something.

1664
01:39:09,734 --> 01:39:11,569
Look out!
Move, move, move!

1665
01:39:13,197 --> 01:39:14,655
We goin' ospedale.

1666
01:39:14,739 --> 01:39:16,323
We gonna make the baby.

1667
01:39:21,204 --> 01:39:22,372
God!

1668
01:39:25,167 --> 01:39:29,045
This is really happening!
I'm going to be a mother!

1669
01:39:29,128 --> 01:39:30,380
Maybe I'm too
old for all this.

1670
01:39:30,546 --> 01:39:31,546
Wait!

1671
01:39:32,341 --> 01:39:33,591
Why are you stopping?

1672
01:39:34,051 --> 01:39:37,552
A margherita with onion and
pineapple, number 17. I thank you.

1673
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:52,568
Who has onion and pineapple?
Some people, they are crazy, no?

1674
01:39:53,404 --> 01:39:54,404
Oh.

1675
01:39:54,904 --> 01:39:55,863
Okay!
Yeah.

1676
01:39:55,948 --> 01:39:56,948
Okay.

1677
01:40:02,203 --> 01:40:04,579
Don't you worry, Miss Bridget.
We get you there?

1678
01:40:04,747 --> 01:40:07,708
There is no traffic this time
of night. It's okay, yeah?

1679
01:40:07,917 --> 01:40:10,627
Poonani!
Poonani! Power to the Poonani!

1680
01:40:12,922 --> 01:40:15,841
I cannot believe, it's a
bloody women's rights march!

1681
01:40:15,926 --> 01:40:18,386
Oh, jeez, not now!

1682
01:40:18,595 --> 01:40:20,762
Christ!
It's those women I defended.

1683
01:40:20,930 --> 01:40:22,472
It's those infernal Russians.
Just hold my hand.

1684
01:40:22,725 --> 01:40:24,391
We really need
to get there.

1685
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:26,435
We need to get there.

1686
01:40:27,563 --> 01:40:28,979
All right!
We're getting out!

1687
01:40:29,105 --> 01:40:30,273
No, I don't think
that's wise. Ready?

1688
01:40:30,356 --> 01:40:31,356
No, Bridget. Bridget!

1689
01:40:34,278 --> 01:40:35,278
Call Jack.

1690
01:40:35,445 --> 01:40:37,738
I come behind with the bags,
Mr. Mark.

1691
01:40:37,905 --> 01:40:39,114
And I call Mr. Jack.

1692
01:40:39,283 --> 01:40:40,408
It's all right, Bridget.
We'll find a way.

1693
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:42,284
I don't think I can walk.

1694
01:40:43,619 --> 01:40:45,454
All right. I'll carry you.

1695
01:41:09,645 --> 01:41:11,521
Good God, Bridget.
You're immense!

1696
01:41:11,689 --> 01:41:13,274
I can't help it!

1697
01:41:15,319 --> 01:41:17,819
I think my lung's collapsed.
But this is not about me.

1698
01:41:18,363 --> 01:41:19,988
My contraction's
starting again!

1699
01:41:20,073 --> 01:41:21,990
I'm going to have
the baby in the street.

1700
01:41:22,158 --> 01:41:23,283
I'll tell you what.

1701
01:41:23,452 --> 01:41:26,328
We'll rest for 10,
and we'll walk for 10.

1702
01:41:26,497 --> 01:41:27,872
All right?
Okay.

1703
01:41:43,805 --> 01:41:46,224
It's not much further?

1704
01:41:46,809 --> 01:41:47,891
No.
No?

1705
01:41:47,975 --> 01:41:49,560
I think it's about...
I don't think...

1706
01:41:49,645 --> 01:41:52,020
...a mile and a half to go.

1707
01:41:52,648 --> 01:41:55,065
Are you okay?

1708
01:41:56,193 --> 01:41:58,444
It's probably best if
I don't talk too much.

1709
01:41:58,529 --> 01:41:59,694
Yes.

1710
01:42:03,533 --> 01:42:06,159
Okay. I'm here. Okay.

1711
01:42:07,537 --> 01:42:09,831
I can take it from here.
I'm here. Okay.

1712
01:42:10,414 --> 01:42:11,707
I got this!

1713
01:42:11,917 --> 01:42:13,583
Thank you!
I got this.

1714
01:42:13,668 --> 01:42:15,545
Okay.

1715
01:42:16,212 --> 01:42:17,212
Jesus!

1716
01:42:18,381 --> 01:42:19,422
Jesus!

1717
01:42:20,884 --> 01:42:21,967
Jesus!

1718
01:42:22,051 --> 01:42:23,469
I'm here.
This is a two-man job.

1719
01:42:23,554 --> 01:42:24,511
Okay.

1720
01:42:24,595 --> 01:42:26,264
Take her. Take her!
I got her. Got her.

1721
01:42:26,430 --> 01:42:28,557
Jesus! Don't drop her!

1722
01:42:35,690 --> 01:42:37,567
Just go in. Okay. Do
you want to go this way?

1723
01:42:37,734 --> 01:42:38,900
Yes. Go there!
No, I'll go this way.

1724
01:42:39,069 --> 01:42:40,278
Okay. Go. Go.

1725
01:42:40,444 --> 01:42:42,195
All right. Squeeze in.

1726
01:42:42,363 --> 01:42:44,073
Are we gonna get in?
All right.

1727
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:45,783
Squeeze in.
I'm squeezing.

1728
01:42:45,993 --> 01:42:47,076
And, push!

1729
01:42:51,164 --> 01:42:52,289
No, no, it's fine.

1730
01:42:55,793 --> 01:42:57,420
We're out.
Okay.

1731
01:42:57,503 --> 01:42:58,503
Nurse!

1732
01:42:58,588 --> 01:42:59,881
Carol, Carol,
wheelchair, wheelchair.

1733
01:43:00,047 --> 01:43:01,256
One, two, three...

1734
01:43:02,466 --> 01:43:05,261
Yes.
Over here, please. Thank you.

1735
01:43:07,890 --> 01:43:08,890
You okay?

1736
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:12,059
Which of you is the father?

1737
01:43:12,144 --> 01:43:13,185
I am.
I am.

1738
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:14,270
Right.

1739
01:43:18,859 --> 01:43:19,859
Oh!

1740
01:43:19,943 --> 01:43:21,444
Breathe out the pain.

1741
01:43:22,904 --> 01:43:25,448
Oh, good! I was wondering
how many fathers we'd get.

1742
01:43:25,615 --> 01:43:28,074
Full house! Bingo!

1743
01:43:28,159 --> 01:43:30,453
Bridget, how do you want
to do this? Epidural?

1744
01:43:30,578 --> 01:43:31,578
No, you can do this.

1745
01:43:31,747 --> 01:43:34,789
A positive mental attitude
is stronger than any drug.

1746
01:43:34,957 --> 01:43:36,417
Just think away the pain.

1747
01:43:36,585 --> 01:43:38,793
Bollocks to that.
No. I want everything.

1748
01:43:38,962 --> 01:43:41,963
Gas, air,
injections, morphine.

1749
01:43:42,131 --> 01:43:43,925
Bridget, remember your yoga.

1750
01:43:44,091 --> 01:43:45,760
Fuck yoga!

1751
01:43:45,927 --> 01:43:47,470
Oh, I couldn't
agree with you more.

1752
01:43:47,637 --> 01:43:49,430
It's supposed to relax one,
but I just spend the entire time

1753
01:43:49,597 --> 01:43:51,806
clenching my sphincter
in an effort not to fart.

1754
01:43:53,143 --> 01:43:55,645
Now, can we turn you over? I
just need to check your cervix.

1755
01:43:59,024 --> 01:44:02,652
You're doing very well. That's
it. Turning around to me. Gently.

1756
01:44:02,985 --> 01:44:04,487
Just a little rummage.

1757
01:44:05,322 --> 01:44:08,157
Right. Ready? Rummaging now.

1758
01:44:11,328 --> 01:44:14,537
Yes. Oh, good, good! You're at eight
centimeters already. That's excellent!

1759
01:44:14,622 --> 01:44:16,498
That means you can't
have any drugs at all.

1760
01:44:16,582 --> 01:44:17,582
What?

1761
01:44:17,667 --> 01:44:19,793
Yes, you're too far gone.
Well done!

1762
01:44:20,170 --> 01:44:21,462
Oh, another contraction.

1763
01:44:23,006 --> 01:44:25,173
I'm not sure how
much there is to gain

1764
01:44:25,341 --> 01:44:27,467
from you two being at the
coalface, if I'm honest.

1765
01:44:27,636 --> 01:44:30,179
My ex-husband said it was like
watching his favorite pub burn down.

1766
01:44:30,346 --> 01:44:31,514
So, your choice.

1767
01:44:34,685 --> 01:44:37,895
Maybe Dad should go
and fetch Mum a cool flannel.

1768
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:45,778
I know, I know. Okay. It's
okay. It's okay.

1769
01:44:46,238 --> 01:44:47,570
You can do this.

1770
01:44:47,738 --> 01:44:50,365
Okay,
just think away the pain.

1771
01:44:50,492 --> 01:44:51,492
Oh!

1772
01:44:52,034 --> 01:44:53,536
Motherfucker.

1773
01:44:53,703 --> 01:44:55,496
Just think away the pain.

1774
01:44:55,747 --> 01:44:57,789
Get out, both of you!

1775
01:44:59,208 --> 01:45:00,751
Where are you going?

1776
01:45:03,713 --> 01:45:07,007
I've changed my mind.

1777
01:45:07,175 --> 01:45:09,885
I've changed my mind.

1778
01:46:05,609 --> 01:46:06,817
You can do this.

1779
01:46:09,404 --> 01:46:11,154
You can.
We can do it together.

1780
01:46:11,323 --> 01:46:13,073
Just think what life's
thrown at you already.

1781
01:46:17,621 --> 01:46:20,081
You've turned
disasters into triumphs

1782
01:46:20,247 --> 01:46:24,585
with your sheer, joyful,
indefatigable, infectious lust for life.

1783
01:46:24,752 --> 01:46:27,837
You've managed this entire pregnancy
almost entirely on your own,

1784
01:46:27,922 --> 01:46:30,006
despite a lunatic mother,

1785
01:46:30,175 --> 01:46:31,216
repressed men,

1786
01:46:31,301 --> 01:46:33,135
and cheating boyfriends
who don't deserve you.

1787
01:46:36,931 --> 01:46:38,349
Just the last few moments.

1788
01:46:38,934 --> 01:46:40,350
Just the last few moments,
my love,

1789
01:46:40,435 --> 01:46:41,644
and then you'll see
your beautiful baby.

1790
01:46:43,688 --> 01:46:44,979
What if it's not yours?

1791
01:46:45,148 --> 01:46:46,481
Then I'll love him anyway.

1792
01:46:46,817 --> 01:46:48,818
Just as I love you.

1793
01:46:49,152 --> 01:46:53,029
Just the way you were, the way you
are, the way you always will be.

1794
01:47:01,622 --> 01:47:03,289
I think you'd better go
and have that seen to.

1795
01:47:03,457 --> 01:47:04,457
Thank you.

1796
01:47:04,876 --> 01:47:06,836
I'll handle it
from here.

1797
01:47:11,173 --> 01:47:12,716
"Think the pain away. "

1798
01:47:12,967 --> 01:47:15,886
You're pushing an entire
human being out of your vagina.

1799
01:47:16,054 --> 01:47:18,055
I'd like to see them
thinking it away.

1800
01:47:20,182 --> 01:47:24,019
And with 367 of the votes,

1801
01:47:24,145 --> 01:47:26,354
the winner is,
Pamela Margaret Jones.

1802
01:47:26,523 --> 01:47:28,189
Pamela! Darling, it's
Bridget.

1803
01:47:28,358 --> 01:47:29,442
Not now, Colin.

1804
01:47:29,525 --> 01:47:30,568
It's about the baby!

1805
01:47:30,734 --> 01:47:34,363
I hereby declare that
Pamela Margaret Jones is...

1806
01:47:34,698 --> 01:47:36,073
I'm so sorry.

1807
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:37,867
You'll have to excuse me.

1808
01:47:38,033 --> 01:47:40,453
We are about to
become a grandmother!

1809
01:47:42,581 --> 01:47:44,457
Well, that's it
for this special

1810
01:47:44,541 --> 01:47:46,833
late-night edition
of Hard News.

1811
01:47:47,377 --> 01:47:50,171
Grams going
at 25 seconds to off-air, 25.

1812
01:47:50,337 --> 01:47:51,505
Bridget's in labor.

1813
01:47:51,672 --> 01:47:53,882
Bridget's in labor!

1814
01:47:54,050 --> 01:47:57,261
Except to say,
Bridget Jones is in labor!

1815
01:48:00,222 --> 01:48:01,765
Yeah! Brilliant!

1816
01:48:04,101 --> 01:48:05,269
Run the credits!

1817
01:48:05,436 --> 01:48:07,270
Run it!
Run the credits! Run it!

1818
01:48:07,439 --> 01:48:08,855
I hope
I'm bloody godmother.

1819
01:48:09,024 --> 01:48:10,440
Cue the fucking weather!

1820
01:48:11,693 --> 01:48:12,693
Listen...

1821
01:48:16,948 --> 01:48:18,908
I owe you
an apology.

1822
01:48:20,409 --> 01:48:23,369
I know I haven't behaved
very well in all this.

1823
01:48:25,414 --> 01:48:26,748
No, it's okay.

1824
01:48:51,483 --> 01:48:52,858
Hello.

1825
01:49:16,091 --> 01:49:19,009
Say hello to
our beautiful boy.

1826
01:49:20,929 --> 01:49:21,929
Go ahead.

1827
01:49:22,596 --> 01:49:23,596
Thank you.

1828
01:49:24,015 --> 01:49:25,015
Hi.

1829
01:49:38,904 --> 01:49:40,363
That's who you are.

1830
01:49:40,532 --> 01:49:41,782
Isn't he perfect?

1831
01:49:41,949 --> 01:49:43,033
Yes.

1832
01:50:04,346 --> 01:50:05,680
Oh, hello.

1833
01:50:09,269 --> 01:50:11,520
I'm so sorry
I'm late, Bridge.

1834
01:50:11,688 --> 01:50:13,771
Some lesbians are having
a stupid all-night march.

1835
01:50:13,939 --> 01:50:15,983
Actually, they're marching
in aid of free speech.

1836
01:50:16,150 --> 01:50:18,402
It's rather important.
Oh, my God. Look at him.

1837
01:50:18,569 --> 01:50:19,903
Bridget.
Bridge.

1838
01:50:20,779 --> 01:50:24,240
I'm so sorry we weren't here.
This unbelievably annoying march...

1839
01:50:24,367 --> 01:50:26,577
Actually, the march is critical
to... Can I be godfather?

1840
01:50:26,661 --> 01:50:29,037
Oh, I'm depending on you.

1841
01:50:29,456 --> 01:50:31,539
Oh, congratulations. Yeah, well
done. Well done. Congratulations.

1842
01:50:31,625 --> 01:50:32,666
Thank you very much.
Well done.

1843
01:50:32,751 --> 01:50:33,751
To both of you.
To all of you.

1844
01:50:33,835 --> 01:50:34,835
My daughter!

1845
01:50:35,002 --> 01:50:36,420
Where is she?

1846
01:50:36,587 --> 01:50:39,631
I'm so sorry we didn't get here
on time! Daddy's parking the car.

1847
01:50:39,798 --> 01:50:41,341
There's some march
for women's rights.

1848
01:50:41,509 --> 01:50:43,761
I mean, honestly, do we
need any more rights?

1849
01:50:44,845 --> 01:50:46,555
Mum, meet your new grandson.

1850
01:50:49,225 --> 01:50:52,394
The darling.
He looks just...

1851
01:50:55,314 --> 01:50:56,899
Not that it matters,

1852
01:50:57,900 --> 01:51:00,069
but do we know
who the daddy is yet?

1853
01:51:02,738 --> 01:51:04,073
Shall we find out?

1854
01:51:06,158 --> 01:51:08,409
Come on, you two.
Time for a little test.

1855
01:51:08,869 --> 01:51:10,162
So exciting, isn't it?

1856
01:51:10,246 --> 01:51:12,288
It's like the final of
The X Factor or something.

1857
01:51:12,457 --> 01:51:14,500
Dial 0-1 if you
want it to be Mark

1858
01:51:14,583 --> 01:51:16,542
and 0-2 if you want
it to be Jack!

1859
01:51:31,475 --> 01:51:32,475
Oh, good luck.

1860
01:51:32,644 --> 01:51:33,851
You, too.

1861
01:51:40,443 --> 01:51:42,110
Please.
Thank you.

1862
01:53:03,067 --> 01:53:04,318
You look beautiful.

1863
01:53:04,569 --> 01:53:05,652
Thank you.

1864
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:08,113
Hello, darling! Hello.

1865
01:53:09,198 --> 01:53:10,364
Hello.

1866
01:53:21,085 --> 01:53:22,293
Hello.

1867
01:53:22,837 --> 01:53:23,878
Hi.

1868
01:53:27,550 --> 01:53:29,301
We're really doing this.

1869
01:53:29,385 --> 01:53:31,845
No going back now.

1870
01:53:32,180 --> 01:53:35,015
We are gathered here
to celebrate the union

1871
01:53:35,182 --> 01:53:39,435
of Bridget Rose Jones
and Mark Fitzwilliam Darcy.

1872
01:53:42,564 --> 01:53:44,983
And by the powers
vested in me,

1873
01:53:45,359 --> 01:53:48,153
I now pronounce you, finally,

1874
01:53:49,154 --> 01:53:51,198
husband and wife.

1875
01:54:34,283 --> 01:54:37,034
Jack, what on earth
are you doing with my son?

1876
01:54:38,121 --> 01:54:39,872
Well, don't leave me
alone with him again.

1877
01:54:39,956 --> 01:54:41,707
I have no idea
what I'm doing.

1878
01:54:42,332 --> 01:54:44,333
Is he traumatized?

1879
01:54:48,965 --> 01:54:50,298
Oh!

1880
01:54:51,216 --> 01:54:54,469
Hello, William Jones-Darcy.

1881
01:54:54,636 --> 01:54:56,179
Are you ready?

1882
01:54:58,682 --> 01:55:01,143
Some champagne for you?
Yes, please.

1883
01:55:02,478 --> 01:55:09,318
Dear Diary, and so, I,
Bridget Jones, am a singleton no more.

1884
01:55:09,652 --> 01:55:11,862
Married? Yes.

1885
01:55:12,029 --> 01:55:13,322
Smug?

1886
01:55:13,488 --> 01:55:17,618
Well, it's about time,
so maybe just a little.
