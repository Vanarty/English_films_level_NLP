1
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,583
At the southern tip of South America,

2
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:44,295
the Andes mountains rise
almost vertically.

3
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:55,514
Their very height affects
life throughout the continent.

4
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:03,064
The barren slopes look inhospitable.

5
00:01:09,654 --> 00:01:14,700
But like all parts of South America,
they're actually rich with wildlife.

6
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:28,089
A family of puma.

7
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:40,268
They live further south
than any other kind of cat on Earth.

8
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:53,281
These cubs are only six months old -

9
00:01:53,406 --> 00:01:56,784
entirely dependent on their mother
for food.

10
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:05,543
She knows how to exploit
this rugged landscape to her advantage.

11
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,012
And she has to do so,

12
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:20,558
if she is to catch the continent's
most challenging prey.

13
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:45,958
Guanaco - a relative of the camel.

14
00:02:49,462 --> 00:02:54,925
Two metres tall and over three times
the weight of a puma.

15
00:02:57,595 --> 00:03:04,143
The mother's only hope is to go for
the throat and try to suffocate her prey.

16
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:16,132
Her cubs try to help...

17
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:30,855
...but they themselves
don't yet have the skills or the weight

18
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,816
to bring down such large prey.

19
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:51,000
And the mother is now badly injured.

20
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:07,516
Her wounds are severe
and will take weeks to heal properly.

21
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:22,656
But without food,
her cubs won't survive for long.

22
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:44,762
The weather in the Andes
is harsh and unpredictable.

23
00:05:55,606 --> 00:06:02,696
Snow makes the camouflage
on which she relies much less effective.

24
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:11,038
But she must have food.

25
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:34,270
The guanaco have left
her normal hunting ground...

26
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:41,860
...and are now in the territory
of a much larger male puma.

27
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,494
He's just made a kill,
but he isn't about to share it with her.

28
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:56,083
To hunt here,
she'll need to leave her cubs behind

29
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,252
in the safety of their home territory.

30
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:29,450
Almost invisible in the shadows,
she's nearly within pouncing distance.

31
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:53,682
Another failure.

32
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:33,055
She's got her speed back.

33
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:54,243
Now she must hold on.

34
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:07,464
But she is in the male's territory,
so her prize isn't safe...

35
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:14,555
...and her hungry cubs
are over kilometre away.

36
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:23,981
In her weakened state,
she will need all her reserves of energy

37
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:27,609
to drag it back onto her territory.

38
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,377
Only her determination
to feed her young keeps her going.

39
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:11,361
Nearly there.

40
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:37,179
This one meal will barely last the whole
family for more than a few days.

41
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:43,227
Then their mother - somehow - will have to
summon the strength to hunt again.

42
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:55,989
Life for a hunter in this land
is as hard as it gets.

43
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:13,090
The Andes themselves were built by forces
deep in the Earth's crust.

44
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:17,928
In this part of the Pacific,

45
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:22,683
the ocean floor has been moving eastwards
for millions of years.

46
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:29,481
Where the sediments meet
the edge of the continent,

47
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:32,067
they're pushed together
and forced upwards.

48
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:41,159
This pressure creates fractures
up which molten rock rises

49
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:46,498
and is then spewed out as ash
and lava from great volcanoes.

50
00:11:55,966 --> 00:12:01,722
Nearly 200 of them stretch in a line
along the length of the continent.

51
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:17,654
Some erupt with the force
of an atomic bomb every ten seconds.

52
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:32,085
As the collision continues,
the sea floor is dragged downwards,

53
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,631
creating a deep trench just offshore.

54
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,762
Rich, cold waters rise up from it.

55
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:48,268
And this upwelling creates
an abundance of life.

56
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:03,200
Here, on the coast of Peru,

57
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:07,037
there are so many seabirds fishing
in the offshore waters

58
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:10,832
that the cliffs are covered
in droppings over a metre thick.

59
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:16,672
Humboldt penguins regard the soft guano

60
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:20,384
as a good material in which to dig
their nest holes.

61
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,473
But it's a messy business.

62
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:38,568
It's the breeding season,
and more hopeful nesters arrive,

63
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:41,780
spotless from swimming in the sea.

64
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:48,036
Time for the residents to get cleaned up
and catch some fish

65
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,497
for themselves and their chicks.

66
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:08,682
To get to the sea, they cross
the remains of an old nesting ground.

67
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:26,992
Only 100 metres to go.

68
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:43,967
But the beach is already crowded
with sea lions.

69
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:54,102
They too have come ashore
to raise their young.

70
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:04,154
And they don't like being disturbed.

71
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:18,502
To get through such a minefield
needs a bold and courageous leader.

72
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,179
A brave start.

73
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:35,685
A dead end.

74
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:39,314
Now he's in trouble.

75
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:49,866
This is going to need
a bit of crowd surfing.

76
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:15,725
But now all the sea lions are roused.

77
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:19,688
Getting through them will be tricky.

78
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:54,181
A cleansing bathe in the ocean...

79
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:56,641
...well worth the effort.

80
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:03,064
The animals living along the Pacific coast

81
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:08,236
are cut off from the rest of South America
by the Andes.

82
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:19,039
They form a gigantic barrier,
stretching over 6,000km

83
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:24,628
from Patagonia in the south
to Venezuela in the north.

84
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:34,721
This is the world's
longest mountain range.

85
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:42,604
Some peaks are almost 7km high.

86
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:47,567
They are so tall they catch clouds...

87
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:54,074
...and so create an environment unlike
any other on the continent.

88
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,881
The cloud forest.

89
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:19,641
Every high valley here
has its own unique plants and animals.

90
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:31,987
One of them is the aptly named
Pinocchio lizard.

91
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:38,118
It was first recorded here 50 years ago
and then lost.

92
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:42,622
It's only recently been rediscovered.

93
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:57,721
Up here lives a creature
so rare that it's seldom seen,

94
00:18:57,846 --> 00:19:01,683
even by those scientists
who have come here to study it.

95
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:06,396
The Andean bear.

96
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,359
Only a few thousand remain.

97
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:25,457
They eat mostly leaves and fruit,

98
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:30,879
often clambering up
to the very top of the canopy to do so.

99
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:52,525
He's looking for a type
of miniature avocado...

100
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,045
...30 metres up.

101
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:25,141
The only fruit remaining here
is out on the thinnest branches -

102
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:27,769
too thin to support the weight of a bear.

103
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:39,114
A more experienced bear
has turned up and wants a go.

104
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:50,417
Time for young ones to watch
and learn how to do it.

105
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:58,049
The trick is to bite the branch
just enough...

106
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:05,014
...to make it swing down
and bring the fruit within reach.

107
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:21,948
Whoops!

108
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:36,671
Now there's a race to be
first on the ground to claim it.

109
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:03,072
The moisture needed
to create a cloud forest

110
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:06,451
only occurs above a certain altitude...

111
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:12,332
...so each peak may now have
its own species.

112
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:20,048
In Venezuela,
there are similar small worlds,

113
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:24,302
created not by rain, but by rock.

114
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:31,267
A great layer of sandstone
once covered this entire area,

115
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:34,020
but rivers cut through it.

116
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:42,737
As the valleys widened,
the tablelands became first huge plateaus,

117
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:46,991
then isolated flat-topped mountains...

118
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:59,295
...and, eventually, towers and spires.

119
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:14,811
On the tops of the bigger ones, animals
and plants have now become so different

120
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:18,481
that they can be counted as new species.

121
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:48,386
There is no higher waterfall
in the world...

122
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:51,848
...than this one.

123
00:23:54,267 --> 00:24:00,648
Angel Falls - almost a kilometre
from top to bottom.

124
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:08,281
The vertical cliffs surrounding
many of these mountains

125
00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:12,410
have kept them largely free
from human exploitation.

126
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:19,334
No such barriers have protected
the lowlands...

127
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:24,297
...but a few patches of forest
still remain.

128
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:34,182
One in Colombia is the home
of one of the world's rarest monkeys.

129
00:24:36,726 --> 00:24:39,103
Cotton-topped tamarins.

130
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:42,357
They're critically endangered.

131
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:53,034
Only a few hundred families remain.

132
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,175
They live largely on fruit

133
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:13,262
and are particularly fond of tree sap.

134
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:21,062
This is packed with sugars,
so it also attracts insects.

135
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:28,027
But tamarins like them too -

136
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:31,906
a little bit of protein
to add to their diet.

137
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:43,334
There used to be over 50,000 species
of insect to choose from...

138
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:51,217
...but as the forest
has shrunk around them,

139
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:54,429
it's becoming more difficult
to find the right ones.

140
00:26:07,191 --> 00:26:09,652
South America is changing.

141
00:26:14,282 --> 00:26:20,621
Over 95% of Colombia's lowland forest
has now been cleared.

142
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:27,879
Farming has taken the biggest share.

143
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:38,473
This patch of forest is now isolated.

144
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:47,815
The few tamarin families here

145
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:52,069
are now cut off
from the rest of their species...

146
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:57,492
...and beyond their boundary
lies an alien world.

147
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:11,672
Today, more than 2,000 species of animal
in South America are under threat.

148
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:19,013
All across the continent,

149
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:24,393
forest is being steadily cut down
and replaced by farms.

150
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:36,864
Images from space
reveal the scale of the destruction.

151
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:54,215
Throughout South America as a whole,

152
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:59,679
an area of forest the size of a football
pitch is being lost every five seconds.

153
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:18,155
Of all the forests at risk,

154
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:23,452
perhaps the most precious
lies in the very heart of the continent.

155
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:27,290
The Amazon rainforest -

156
00:28:27,415 --> 00:28:29,500
the largest on Earth.

157
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:46,893
Over two million species of plants
and animals now live here -

158
00:28:47,018 --> 00:28:51,772
more than is found on any other
of the Earth's seven continents.

159
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:25,681
Food is so abundant that some male birds,
instead of helping with nest duties,

160
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:29,727
try to mate with as many females
as possible.

161
00:29:31,729 --> 00:29:36,275
This is a male manakin
showing off to a female.

162
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,862
He does so by dancing...

163
00:29:42,657 --> 00:29:46,327
...and he has a team
of subordinate males to help him.

164
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:55,628
By supporting him now, they may
themselves eventually become leaders

165
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:57,880
and get a chance to mate.

166
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:11,018
The team is assembled
and the performance begins.

167
00:30:16,107 --> 00:30:17,942
She takes a closer look.

168
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:04,238
The top male signals the end
with a final flourish.

169
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,834
What's the verdict?

170
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:26,052
Not good enough.

171
00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:29,722
Unbelievable!

172
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:37,730
So it's back to practising.

173
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:56,082
Each animal species in this crowded
environment has to have its own way

174
00:31:56,207 --> 00:31:58,542
of creating a niche for itself.

175
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:07,843
This is a poison dart frog.

176
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:13,057
Males raise their young
in a very special way.

177
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:22,316
A father will place each one of his
tadpoles in its own tiny pool of water.

178
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:25,319
This is one.

179
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,696
Nice and safe.

180
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:34,662
He might have up to five other tadpoles.

181
00:32:36,372 --> 00:32:40,501
But he needs to remember
where he put each one of them.

182
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:47,133
This one isn't doing so well.

183
00:32:47,258 --> 00:32:51,303
His tiny puddle has all but dried out.

184
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:57,309
The tadpole will die unless its father
can find a better place for it.

185
00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:05,734
If dads are good for one thing,
it's piggyback rides.

186
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:19,248
Fathers are no bigger
than a human thumbnail,

187
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:23,961
but this enables them
to get to places that others can't.

188
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:27,339
This could be perfect.

189
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:37,433
The only problem
is that there's no food here.

190
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:42,146
Fathers need help.

191
00:33:48,903 --> 00:33:51,197
Somewhere in this forest...

192
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,035
...is...

193
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,620
...mum.

194
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:16,096
A female could do something
a male cannot.

195
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:23,395
But first, dad must lead his partner
to their hungry tadpole...

196
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:42,206
...and mother deals with the problem.

197
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:48,420
She lays a single unfertilised egg.

198
00:34:56,095 --> 00:35:01,100
And her tadpole gets a much-needed meal.

199
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:08,524
For the next six weeks,
parents continue their rounds -

200
00:35:08,649 --> 00:35:13,279
an extraordinary test of teamwork
and memory.

201
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:24,248
Warmed by the tropical sun, the Amazon's
trees release so much moisture

202
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:29,044
from the surface of their leaves
that they create their own clouds.

203
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:36,427
And these, over the course of a year,
release up to six metres of rain.

204
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:46,979
The water flows through the saturated
forest along a thousand streams.

205
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,403
They eventually unite to form
the largest river of them all.

206
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,826
The Amazon carries more water

207
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:04,496
than the world's next seven biggest rivers
combined.

208
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:11,920
Some sections of its banks
are particularly sought-after.

209
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:26,518
Scarlet macaws travel over 100 kilometres
to visit them.

210
00:36:35,194 --> 00:36:41,450
Macaw couples bond for life
and may stick together for over 40 years.

211
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:55,047
Pairs return to favourite trees,
ones they've known for decades.

212
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:03,222
Parents provide their chicks
with fruits and seeds,

213
00:37:03,347 --> 00:37:08,435
but they're far from the ocean
and their diet lacks salt.

214
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:13,941
Without it, the chicks' brains
and bones will not develop properly.

215
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:19,029
So someone has to go and fetch it.

216
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:35,879
Many other creatures are looking
for the same thing...

217
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:42,386
...a clay lick.

218
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:48,600
The earth here may be 40 times
richer in valuable minerals

219
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:52,438
than anywhere else
in the surrounding forest.

220
00:37:55,649 --> 00:38:00,362
Over a dozen species of parrot
jostle for space.

221
00:38:02,406 --> 00:38:03,490
There's a strict order...

222
00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:07,369
...in who feeds first.

223
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:15,586
Everyone is in a rush
to fill up and get airborne.

224
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:47,743
Parents have to carry over 5kg of clay
to the nest

225
00:38:47,868 --> 00:38:50,370
before their chicks are ready to leave.

226
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:59,046
Once fledged, these young will follow
their parents for up to a year,

227
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:02,633
learning where to find the salts.

228
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:21,818
Many of the great riches of South America
lie far beyond the Amazon basin.

229
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:29,117
Over 1,000 miles
to the south of the Amazon,

230
00:39:29,243 --> 00:39:33,956
there's one creek
unlike any other on the continent.

231
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:53,725
Here at Bonito, freshwater springs
bubble up from deep underground.

232
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:02,985
Filtered through limestone,
they create crystal-clear pools...

233
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:09,783
...and in them live some remarkable fish.

234
00:40:11,785 --> 00:40:13,870
Piraputanga.

235
00:40:15,372 --> 00:40:22,004
The water is so clear that they're able to
see what is going on above its surface.

236
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:32,514
Brown capuchins are up there,
looking for a meal.

237
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:44,401
The piraputanga watch them
attentively.

238
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:51,241
Wherever the monkeys go
along the banks, the fish follow.

239
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:03,879
The monkeys are on
their daily search for ripe fruit,

240
00:41:04,004 --> 00:41:09,301
and the fish cannot by themselves know
where that might be.

241
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,097
But here it is.

242
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:28,987
And fortunately, the monkeys aren't the
neatest of feeders.

243
00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:50,217
Every scrap is fought over.

244
00:41:57,724 --> 00:42:02,312
One monkey has the job
of keeping an eye out for danger.

245
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:19,788
Anacondas are the largest of all snakes.

246
00:42:23,542 --> 00:42:26,795
They grow to over 200kg.

247
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:33,552
And they usually
stalk their prey from the water...

248
00:42:37,973 --> 00:42:41,727
...but it's not fish that they're after.

249
00:42:52,362 --> 00:42:59,619
If the monkeys stray too close
to the water, they will be in danger.

250
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:15,510
The scout gives a warning call.

251
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:33,570
That might have to be the end
of the monkey's meal for today.

252
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:39,618
But now the piraputanga
know where the fruit is.

253
00:43:41,453 --> 00:43:44,748
And there's still plenty left on the tree.

254
00:43:48,794 --> 00:43:52,380
In the monkeys' absence,
they go for it themselves.

255
00:44:02,182 --> 00:44:06,311
Success or failure
is just a matter of millimetres.

256
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:27,999
With a split-second adjustment,
the fish bends in midair

257
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:31,419
and collects the prize.

258
00:44:54,818 --> 00:44:58,363
The piraputanga's extraordinary
feeding technique

259
00:44:58,488 --> 00:45:01,867
relies on these waters remaining clear.

260
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:13,795
But today, the future of South America's
rivers has become uncertain.

261
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:22,637
As the human population has grown,
people have become more and more reliant

262
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:27,350
on its rivers for one of the essentials
of modern life.

263
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:31,563
Power.

264
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:39,112
Two-thirds of South America's energy
now comes from hydroelectricity.

265
00:45:41,031 --> 00:45:45,619
No other region on Earth
is so dependent upon it.

266
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:52,876
But the way these dams are managed can
cause problems farther downriver.

267
00:46:00,008 --> 00:46:02,761
These are the Iguazu Falls.

268
00:46:08,934 --> 00:46:15,815
If the dams upriver suddenly release
their excess, Iguazu can double in size.

269
00:46:20,862 --> 00:46:25,784
And that can cause major problems
for animals that live here.

270
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:36,294
These are great dusky swifts.

271
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:40,298
They fly alarmingly close
to the thundering torrent...

272
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:44,177
...and then vanish.

273
00:46:50,225 --> 00:46:55,981
Miraculously, they're able to fly right
through the curtain of water.

274
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:05,532
And they do so because they've built
their nests behind the thundering curtain.

275
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:13,248
Their enemies - falcons,
like this caracara - can't follow them.

276
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:19,671
So the swift chicks are safe.

277
00:47:35,854 --> 00:47:40,984
But now humans have created
new problems for the swifts.

278
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:45,030
Just as some of the chicks
are starting to fly,

279
00:47:45,155 --> 00:47:49,451
the spill over the dams
is released in full force.

280
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:07,093
As the torrent grows,
parents give up on the last perches.

281
00:48:21,191 --> 00:48:24,027
Now the chicks are alone.

282
00:48:29,074 --> 00:48:33,661
But they don't yet have
their parents' waterproof feathers.

283
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:43,254
Every year, the sudden surges of water
sweep some to their death.

284
00:48:52,472 --> 00:48:56,768
The chicks have never seen the world
beyond the falling waters.

285
00:49:09,781 --> 00:49:13,743
Unless they can find a way through,
they will not survive.

286
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:40,728
Amazingly, driven by blind instinct,

287
00:49:40,854 --> 00:49:45,066
chicks do manage
to power their way through.

288
00:49:58,663 --> 00:50:06,171
These remarkable birds have colonised
a niche in which few can survive.

289
00:50:09,174 --> 00:50:13,720
Yet their future,
and that of all wildlife in South America,

290
00:50:13,845 --> 00:50:20,727
will depend on us striking a balance
between the needs of humans and animals,

291
00:50:20,852 --> 00:50:26,149
on the richest and most diverse continent
on Earth.

292
00:50:37,035 --> 00:50:38,828
Next time...

293
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:40,955
...a continent marooned

294
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:44,042
during the time of the dinosaurs,

295
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:46,127
where the castaways...

296
00:50:47,879 --> 00:50:50,590
...are like nothing else on Earth.

297
00:50:56,971 --> 00:50:59,933
Australia.
