1
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:34,775
<i>Hey there, all you sleepy
Angelenos. A good, good morning to you.</i>

2
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,477
<i>It's your buddy, Romeo Midnight.
I know.</i>

3
00:00:38,654 --> 00:00:41,646
<i>I'm the voice you normally
listen to in the middle of the night.</i>

4
00:00:41,824 --> 00:00:47,353
<i>But today is special, Los Angeles.
It's my favorite day of the year.</i>

5
00:00:47,529 --> 00:00:50,828
<i>Today is Valentine's Day.</i>

6
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:56,130
<i>And that's why I'll be here all day and
all night, playing the songs you love...</i>

7
00:00:56,305 --> 00:01:00,264
<i>...and the songs you love
to love to.</i>

8
00:02:46,481 --> 00:02:48,039
Hi.

9
00:02:48,717 --> 00:02:50,207
Okay.

10
00:02:51,353 --> 00:02:56,222
When I was a kid, most of the advice
that my dad gave me was crap.

11
00:02:57,526 --> 00:03:00,689
There's one thing that he said
that was pure genius.

12
00:03:01,964 --> 00:03:05,456
He said, "If you ever are with a girl...

13
00:03:06,935 --> 00:03:09,096
...that's too good for you...

14
00:03:10,138 --> 00:03:11,366
...marry her."

15
00:03:14,576 --> 00:03:16,168
So...

16
00:03:17,746 --> 00:03:19,179
Wow.

17
00:03:28,523 --> 00:03:32,015
- Really?
- Happy Valentine's Day.

18
00:03:32,194 --> 00:03:35,129
Happy Valentine's Day.

19
00:03:41,803 --> 00:03:43,236
She said yes!

20
00:03:55,684 --> 00:04:00,417
Julia, call me as soon as you get this.
I got big news. Big news.

21
00:04:00,589 --> 00:04:03,080
- She said yes.
- You're kidding.

22
00:04:03,258 --> 00:04:05,658
- What?
- I mean, you're kidding!

23
00:04:05,827 --> 00:04:08,455
- You thought she'd say no.
- Man, come on. You know me...

24
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,155
...always preparing for the worst.
Immigrant mentality.

25
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:14,461
- Forget it. She said yes. This is good news.
- Yeah, and get this:

26
00:04:14,636 --> 00:04:20,074
I don't even have to play it cool today.
I can be a sappy cheeseball all day...

27
00:04:20,242 --> 00:04:24,042
...mooning about love to total strangers,
and no one'll think I'm a moron.

28
00:04:24,212 --> 00:04:26,942
Because it's Valentine's Day, huh?

29
00:04:27,115 --> 00:04:30,380
And everyone is romantic
on Valentine's Day.

30
00:04:32,321 --> 00:04:36,052
Get your head out of your ass
and use your damn turn signal...

31
00:04:36,224 --> 00:04:38,715
...you freaking moron.

32
00:04:40,696 --> 00:04:42,357
<i>Good morning, Los Angeles.</i>

33
00:04:42,531 --> 00:04:46,592
<i>I'm Sherry Donaldson
with the KVLA news team.</i>

34
00:04:46,768 --> 00:04:50,431
- And now let's check the weather.
- Good morning.

35
00:04:52,307 --> 00:04:55,868
Sun shines on late morning,
and look at these numbers.

36
00:04:56,044 --> 00:04:59,980
Highs in the upper valleys in the 60s,
and a bit cloudy by the coast...

37
00:05:00,148 --> 00:05:04,107
...until mid-morning,
when the marine layer burns off.

38
00:05:04,386 --> 00:05:06,354
Susan, what the hell is this?

39
00:05:06,521 --> 00:05:10,150
Oh, the boss thinks
it's gonna up the ratings.

40
00:05:10,325 --> 00:05:12,486
And we're clear.

41
00:05:12,661 --> 00:05:15,459
Not talking about Pippi Longstocking,
I'm talking about this.

42
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,996
I'm a sports journalist,
I don't do lifestyle.

43
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:21,033
You're my number two sports journalist,
Kelvin, which means...

44
00:05:21,203 --> 00:05:24,604
...that on slow sports days,
you do the pieces I want you to do.

45
00:05:24,773 --> 00:05:27,139
The station wants more fluff.

46
00:05:27,309 --> 00:05:30,540
I'll do some follow-up stories,
do some investigative reporting...

47
00:05:30,712 --> 00:05:31,804
...bring it back to you?

48
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,245
There's only one story today, Kelvin.
It's all yours.

49
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:38,477
It's not complicated.
It's your basic man on the street.

50
00:05:38,987 --> 00:05:44,050
"Tell me, John Q, Jane Q,
what does Valentine's Day mean to you?"

51
00:05:44,226 --> 00:05:46,626
It gives me acid reflux.
That's what it means to me.

52
00:05:46,795 --> 00:05:49,855
We spend a lot of money. Nobody cares.
It's not a real holiday.

53
00:05:50,032 --> 00:05:51,932
We don't take the day off.
Come on, Susan.

54
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,298
And we're coming back
in five, four, three...

55
00:05:56,872 --> 00:05:59,204
Listen, I'm a player...

56
00:05:59,374 --> 00:06:02,275
...but I shut down my player-ness...

57
00:06:02,444 --> 00:06:06,175
...from New Year's to Saint Paddy's Day
just so I can avoid this day.

58
00:06:07,215 --> 00:06:11,049
I need happy, I need romantic,
I need love...

59
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:12,709
...and I need it from you.

60
00:06:13,422 --> 00:06:15,049
You need Jesus.

61
00:06:16,224 --> 00:06:18,784
Go. Go away now.

62
00:06:32,107 --> 00:06:34,735
Sunflowers! Beautiful!

63
00:06:59,267 --> 00:07:01,326
Good morning!

64
00:07:04,673 --> 00:07:06,607
- Hello, good morning.
- Hello, hello.

65
00:07:06,775 --> 00:07:09,437
I need my lucky bamboo.
Actually, I need both flats, and...

66
00:07:09,611 --> 00:07:12,512
- Do you hav...? I actually need the whole lot.
- All of them?

67
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:15,377
- Want my Gerbera daisies too?
- No, no, no. No... Yes.

68
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,609
Alphonso's gonna
pick everything up later.

69
00:07:17,786 --> 00:07:21,153
- Mr. Reed, why are you always happy?
- Why not be always happy?

70
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:24,453
- Reed?
- Simon.

71
00:07:24,626 --> 00:07:25,957
- Reed.
- What's up, man?

72
00:07:26,128 --> 00:07:27,220
- How are you?
- All right.

73
00:07:27,395 --> 00:07:30,023
- What's going on?
- Hey, I'm gonna be on TV.

74
00:07:30,198 --> 00:07:32,223
- Interviewer over there.
- Really?

75
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,062
Nice! Listen, I need to talk to you.

76
00:07:35,237 --> 00:07:36,727
Morley said yes.

77
00:07:37,572 --> 00:07:38,732
She said yes?

78
00:07:38,907 --> 00:07:41,774
What is with everybody?
She said yes. I'm getting married.

79
00:07:41,943 --> 00:07:42,967
It's great news, huh?

80
00:07:45,046 --> 00:07:48,311
Listen, I need to get her something,
like, really nice, though, like...

81
00:07:48,483 --> 00:07:51,714
Not roses, something out of the ordinary,
you know?

82
00:07:51,887 --> 00:07:53,320
Ah... Huh.

83
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:57,518
- Wow, what is it?
- No, no, no.

84
00:07:57,692 --> 00:08:01,560
Do not open until perfect moment.

85
00:08:01,763 --> 00:08:04,163
Ready for the interview.

86
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,267
Kelvin Moore here, KVLA Channel 13...

87
00:08:07,435 --> 00:08:11,735
...right here at the downtown
flower mart with Mr. Simon Pham...

88
00:08:11,907 --> 00:08:13,738
...that's P-H-A-M, not with an F.

89
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:17,868
Mr. Pham, how many red roses do you sell
on Valentine's Day?

90
00:08:18,046 --> 00:08:20,674
The Captain and Tennille
were married on Valentine's Day.

91
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:21,873
What's that you said?

92
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,678
The Captain and Tennille were married
on Valentine's Day.

93
00:08:24,853 --> 00:08:28,949
A hundred and ten million red roses
are sold in America every Valentine's Day.

94
00:08:29,124 --> 00:08:33,151
- Sixty percent are produced in California.
- Does he work for you? I mean...

95
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:34,352
I'm a florist.

96
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:37,760
I own Siena Bouquet, 2173 Rosewood.

97
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:39,833
- And what's your name, sir?
- Reed Bennett.

98
00:08:40,001 --> 00:08:43,630
- Hi. How are you? Sports guy. Sports.
- Reed Bennett. Yeah, sports.

99
00:08:43,805 --> 00:08:46,000
- Okay, from Santa Montica...
- Siena Bouquet.

100
00:08:46,174 --> 00:08:48,836
- Santa... What is it? Siena Bouquet.
- Siena Bouquet.

101
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,342
In the Val... Off of Ventura.

102
00:09:01,356 --> 00:09:04,052
Well, you do have a flaw after all.

103
00:09:04,226 --> 00:09:06,820
- Oh, yeah? What's that?
- Your job.

104
00:09:06,995 --> 00:09:08,394
I thought women liked doctors.

105
00:09:09,965 --> 00:09:14,493
We do like lab coats, but the flying
around everywhere is not so good.

106
00:09:14,669 --> 00:09:16,830
I'm only going to San Francisco
for one night.

107
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,001
Couldn't somebody else do it,
just tonight?

108
00:09:21,176 --> 00:09:22,336
No, I'm the best.

109
00:09:23,745 --> 00:09:27,647
If it's any consolation,
when I'm fixing his heart...

110
00:09:27,816 --> 00:09:30,546
...you can hold mine.

111
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:33,882
Oh. Thank you.

112
00:09:35,523 --> 00:09:39,892
Hey, what are you doing? No.
I can't miss my plane. No.

113
00:09:43,231 --> 00:09:46,098
I can't believe you're leaving me
on Valentine's Day.

114
00:09:46,268 --> 00:09:48,930
- You said you had something to do.
- I do have something.

115
00:09:49,104 --> 00:09:52,665
I do have something to do.
I just don't know that I wanna do it.

116
00:09:52,841 --> 00:09:55,036
- You know my friend Kara?
- Which one's Kara?

117
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,700
Neurotic, hot mess.

118
00:09:56,878 --> 00:10:00,780
She throws this annual
"I Hate Valentine's Day" dinner.

119
00:10:01,349 --> 00:10:05,649
- It's a bit of a downer, actually.
- What's there to hate?

120
00:10:06,254 --> 00:10:09,348
Nothing, if you're a handsome,
divorced doctor.

121
00:10:09,524 --> 00:10:13,051
But for the rest of us single women,
it's kind of a giant cosmic bitch slap.

122
00:10:13,228 --> 00:10:16,026
It's the universe saying,
"Look, remember when you were 14...

123
00:10:16,197 --> 00:10:18,062
...and you had cystic acne and braces...

124
00:10:18,233 --> 00:10:20,326
...and you played the saxophone
in the band...

125
00:10:20,502 --> 00:10:23,027
...and no one would invite you
to the winter formal?

126
00:10:23,204 --> 00:10:24,432
Well, nothing's changed."

127
00:10:26,007 --> 00:10:29,374
I would crawl over cut glass
to take you to the winter formal.

128
00:10:29,544 --> 00:10:31,808
And then I would prescribe Retin-A
for your skin.

129
00:10:34,015 --> 00:10:36,506
That's why you're my valentine.

130
00:10:36,685 --> 00:10:38,516
<i>So we have a professional here.</i>

131
00:10:38,687 --> 00:10:41,155
<i>I'm sure you've heard a lot of stories
on Valentine's Day.</i>

132
00:10:41,323 --> 00:10:42,654
<i>Do you still believe in love?</i>

133
00:10:42,824 --> 00:10:46,885
<i>Hell, yes. Love is the only shocking act
left on the planet.</i>

134
00:10:47,062 --> 00:10:51,431
<i>Well, if he said it, folks,
it must be true, because he is a florist.</i>

135
00:11:06,181 --> 00:11:07,842
What is it?

136
00:11:08,016 --> 00:11:09,176
Oh, you're up.

137
00:11:09,851 --> 00:11:12,911
- Did you get my good side?
- I don't know. Roll over.

138
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,084
Last night...

139
00:11:22,397 --> 00:11:23,762
Was...?

140
00:11:23,932 --> 00:11:25,297
- Amazing.
- Okay, thank you.

141
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:29,369
- Wow. Well, I used to be a gymnast.
- Oh, well, that explains a lot.

142
00:11:29,537 --> 00:11:31,732
Yeah, I didn't hurt you, right?

143
00:11:32,273 --> 00:11:35,333
- You're so cute.
- I thought you wanted to be a poet...

144
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:38,206
...not a photographer.
- A girl can change her mind, Jason.

145
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,678
That's how last night happened.

146
00:11:40,849 --> 00:11:45,445
- Anyway, I could not write that photo.
- Okay, yeah. Um...

147
00:11:46,121 --> 00:11:48,885
Is my nose kind of...?
It looks kind of big for my face.

148
00:11:49,057 --> 00:11:52,515
I think that's L.A. Talking.
I think you have a great nose.

149
00:12:00,368 --> 00:12:01,699
Oh, my God. Is that the time?

150
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:05,670
What? What? No, it's 3 minutes fast.
I don't like being late.

151
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,434
- I have to go. I just...
- Just like that?

152
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:11,408
Yeah, I'm sorry. I just...
Skirt? Skirt, skirt, skirt.

153
00:12:12,814 --> 00:12:16,147
What? Oh, right.
I think I half-remember that.

154
00:12:16,317 --> 00:12:19,684
- Three minutes? Why not 5 minutes ahead?
- I don't wanna seem eager.

155
00:12:19,854 --> 00:12:21,549
But, yeah, you know what? Stay.

156
00:12:21,723 --> 00:12:24,715
Hang out for a little bit.
Maybe we can grab breakfast.

157
00:12:27,195 --> 00:12:31,757
- Oh, I knew it. I knew it.
- What is that, techno?

158
00:12:31,933 --> 00:12:33,127
- What?
- The ring.

159
00:12:33,301 --> 00:12:38,933
Oh, no, I think it's, like,
a little more retro. It's kind of '70s.

160
00:12:39,107 --> 00:12:42,440
Thank you so much for last night.
I had a blast.

161
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,874
And there is fresh coffee for you
in the kitchen.

162
00:12:45,046 --> 00:12:46,775
- I think I'm out of coffee.
- You were.

163
00:12:46,948 --> 00:12:49,508
I borrowed some from your neighbor.
She was surprised...

164
00:12:49,684 --> 00:12:52,118
...you had female company,
thought that you were gay.

165
00:12:52,287 --> 00:12:54,016
Don't worry, I set her straight.

166
00:12:59,294 --> 00:13:00,818
Bye.

167
00:13:19,481 --> 00:13:20,971
Hi.

168
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:25,984
Oh, I was thinking about you
all night long.

169
00:13:27,222 --> 00:13:30,885
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't answer
on the first ring.

170
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:32,720
It's not my fault.

171
00:13:32,894 --> 00:13:35,294
I was thinking about
what you were gonna do to me...

172
00:13:35,463 --> 00:13:40,298
...and I just couldn't wait.
I didn't have a free hand.

173
00:13:40,468 --> 00:13:47,306
Oh, baby.
You know just how Katia likes it. Mm.

174
00:13:48,176 --> 00:13:50,804
Well, it's Valentine's Day, sugar.

175
00:13:50,979 --> 00:13:53,243
How about something special?

176
00:13:53,414 --> 00:13:57,350
My roommate just got home.
Do you wanna have a threesome?

177
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,987
If he says yes,
it'll take me a minute to change.

178
00:14:02,056 --> 00:14:06,493
Ooh. I think that's a very good idea.

179
00:14:29,751 --> 00:14:33,312
Edgar, we said we were not gonna
give each other presents this year.

180
00:14:33,488 --> 00:14:35,979
I know, I lied.

181
00:14:37,859 --> 00:14:39,724
- So did I.
- Wow.

182
00:14:39,894 --> 00:14:43,955
<i>Today's the day I make most of my dough.
I deliver love-grams to businesses.</i>

183
00:14:44,132 --> 00:14:45,963
<i>I even delivered a breakup-gram today.</i>

184
00:14:46,134 --> 00:14:48,466
<i>Folks, from the chubby messenger
of love himself...</i>

185
00:14:48,636 --> 00:14:50,399
<i>...that Valentine's Day is about love.</i>

186
00:14:50,572 --> 00:14:52,904
<i>It's about romance.
It's about commercialism that...</i>

187
00:14:53,074 --> 00:14:55,702
- Found the glue, Grandma.
- Well, good.

188
00:14:56,477 --> 00:14:58,638
This is really a hard day for him...

189
00:14:58,813 --> 00:15:02,647
...because they used to make
handcrafted cards together.

190
00:15:02,817 --> 00:15:05,285
Well, maybe we should've offered
to do that with him.

191
00:15:05,453 --> 00:15:06,477
I did.

192
00:15:06,654 --> 00:15:09,555
But he said it was only fun
when it was with his mother.

193
00:15:10,592 --> 00:15:13,254
So, Edison...

194
00:15:13,695 --> 00:15:17,927
...what are we doing for breakfast today?
- I can't eat, Grandpa.

195
00:15:18,099 --> 00:15:20,590
Who said that? So you can't eat?

196
00:15:20,768 --> 00:15:23,601
What's the matter?
What's the matter, you sick?

197
00:15:24,072 --> 00:15:27,041
Yeah. Lovesick.

198
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:32,006
<i>Julia, it's Reed.
I've been trying to reach you.</i>

199
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,238
<i>Call me back, please.</i>

200
00:15:37,352 --> 00:15:39,081
Oh, boy. Oh.

201
00:15:39,253 --> 00:15:42,017
- Hi.
- Hi.

202
00:15:42,957 --> 00:15:45,755
So my boyfriend texted me this morning.

203
00:15:45,927 --> 00:15:48,987
And he was like,
"Look outside your door."

204
00:15:49,163 --> 00:15:50,391
Oh.

205
00:15:50,565 --> 00:15:53,056
And... But, you know,
I look outside my door...

206
00:15:53,234 --> 00:15:55,600
...and my boyfriend's
nowhere to be found.

207
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:56,828
Right.

208
00:15:57,005 --> 00:15:59,439
- But there's this giant white bear.
- Yeah, the bear.

209
00:15:59,607 --> 00:16:01,438
- On the ground. The floor.
- I get it.

210
00:16:01,609 --> 00:16:04,840
- Yeah. Isn't that the sweetest thing ever?
- Ever and ever.

211
00:16:05,346 --> 00:16:09,077
Do you live here? In this building?
Because I see you in the lobby all the time.

212
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:13,653
- Because I live here.
- No, I just visit. Just visiting.

213
00:16:14,489 --> 00:16:17,083
All right, well,
I'm gonna go to school now.

214
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:18,755
Gonna take my bear with me.

215
00:16:18,926 --> 00:16:21,690
- I hope you get a lot of valentines today.
- Thanks.

216
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:27,328
<i>Hello, everyone.
This is your captain speaking.</i>

217
00:16:27,502 --> 00:16:29,333
<i>On behalf of myself and the flight deck...</i>

218
00:16:29,504 --> 00:16:31,972
<i>...we wanted to wish everyone
a happy Valentine's Day.</i>

219
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,404
<i>Hope you had an opportunity
to get a little rest.</i>

220
00:16:34,575 --> 00:16:38,238
<i>But according to my digital readout here,
we've still got another six hours...</i>

221
00:16:38,413 --> 00:16:41,405
<i>...before we reach our final destination
of Los Angeles...</i>

222
00:16:41,582 --> 00:16:46,144
<i>...where the weather is expected to be warm
and sunny after three days of rain.</i>

223
00:16:51,225 --> 00:16:52,317
- Oh, hello.
- Hey.

224
00:16:52,493 --> 00:16:55,257
- Hey, is Reed here, or is he on a run?
- Yeah, he's in there.

225
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,057
- Okay. Hey, guys.
- Hi, Julia.

226
00:16:57,231 --> 00:16:58,926
- How was last night, brutal?
- Yeah.

227
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,624
- Have you been up all night?
- Hey.

228
00:17:00,802 --> 00:17:05,102
- Wow, everybody's here today.
- Oh, whose child is this? Hello?

229
00:17:05,273 --> 00:17:07,867
- Oh, there's your mother.
- Please hold.

230
00:17:08,042 --> 00:17:09,566
- Hey, Nikki.
- Good morning.

231
00:17:09,744 --> 00:17:11,712
Oh, these are yellow. Where's Reed?

232
00:17:11,879 --> 00:17:14,370
<i>Your pal's in the café.
The pastries were late.</i>

233
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:16,608
Oh, yeah. I think he might be having
a rough morning.

234
00:17:17,985 --> 00:17:19,043
Hello, Siena Bouquet.

235
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,710
- Hey. Reed.
- Just need...

236
00:17:20,888 --> 00:17:23,823
We need the morning glories.
Oh, there they are. Perfect. Great.

237
00:17:23,991 --> 00:17:27,392
- Hey, I got your message. You okay?
- Yeah.

238
00:17:27,562 --> 00:17:31,089
- What happened?
- Well, you just sounded like...

239
00:17:31,399 --> 00:17:34,334
- You sounded like maybe she said...
- "Yes."

240
00:17:35,703 --> 00:17:36,727
- She said yes.
- No.

241
00:17:36,904 --> 00:17:38,565
Why doesn't anybody have confidence?

242
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,469
- She said yes?
- Yes.

243
00:17:40,641 --> 00:17:46,170
Oh, my goodness. Okay. I didn't...
I didn't get it, but congratulations!

244
00:17:46,347 --> 00:17:51,683
- Call me Mr. Engaged.
- You're getting married.

245
00:17:52,487 --> 00:17:54,887
Hi, I ordered some tulips.

246
00:17:55,056 --> 00:17:57,752
Yes. You can't put the baby on the counter,
it's dangerous.

247
00:17:57,925 --> 00:18:01,190
- But I can't get my money out.
- She should be off the counter. Thanks.

248
00:18:01,362 --> 00:18:03,956
- Here, let me hold her.
- Thank you.

249
00:18:04,132 --> 00:18:06,965
- You should know we're Jewish.
- God loves us all.

250
00:18:07,135 --> 00:18:08,762
- Thank you.
- Hello, Siena Bouquet.

251
00:18:10,605 --> 00:18:13,005
He's the first decent guy
I've dated in a long time.

252
00:18:13,674 --> 00:18:14,902
It's going that well, huh?

253
00:18:15,076 --> 00:18:17,772
I am so sick of dating.
I'm so jealous of you guys.

254
00:18:17,945 --> 00:18:20,436
When do I get to meet
the phantom physician?

255
00:18:20,615 --> 00:18:23,243
- I think soon.
- You guys got plans tonight?

256
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:26,853
No. He has to go to San Francisco,
so we're gonna talk on the phone.

257
00:18:27,488 --> 00:18:29,217
You know what you should do?

258
00:18:29,824 --> 00:18:31,553
You should fly up and surprise him.

259
00:18:31,726 --> 00:18:33,660
- You think so?
- Yeah. Why not?

260
00:18:33,828 --> 00:18:35,261
- No.
- Come on.

261
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:36,953
I don't know where he's staying...

262
00:18:37,131 --> 00:18:39,964
You make a call, you find out.
What's the big deal?

263
00:18:40,134 --> 00:18:44,127
- God, you really think I should go?
- Why not?

264
00:18:44,305 --> 00:18:47,706
Come on, it's Valentine's Day.
You don't think. You just do.

265
00:18:52,213 --> 00:18:53,646
Go.

266
00:18:57,084 --> 00:18:59,848
- Get out of here.
- Congratulations.

267
00:19:21,242 --> 00:19:22,766
<i>- Hello there.
- Hi.</i>

268
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:26,072
Hey, honey.
I'm just pulling into the airport.

269
00:19:26,247 --> 00:19:27,714
<i>I'll call you when I land, okay?</i>

270
00:19:27,882 --> 00:19:31,340
Okay, I get it. Okay, have a safe flight.
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

271
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:33,248
Thanks. Bye-bye.

272
00:19:56,077 --> 00:19:58,272
Hello. Good morning. I'm home.

273
00:19:58,446 --> 00:20:00,175
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey, peanut.

274
00:20:01,015 --> 00:20:02,710
Hi, sweetie.

275
00:20:02,884 --> 00:20:05,352
- Did you fix all the broken hearts?
- I did.

276
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:07,919
- I did.
- Happy Valentine's Day.

277
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:09,716
Happy Valentine's Day to you.

278
00:20:10,658 --> 00:20:14,025
- Surgery went late. I stayed at the condo.
- I figured.

279
00:20:15,162 --> 00:20:16,652
Doesn't Daddy juggle well?

280
00:20:16,831 --> 00:20:18,128
- Yeah.
- Mm-hm.

281
00:20:37,518 --> 00:20:38,542
What are you doing?

282
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:43,349
Sorry, l... Excuse me,
I was trying to close the window.

283
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:46,517
I'm sorry.

284
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:52,055
No. For leaning on my shoulder? Come on,
it's the least I could do. A 14-hour flight.

285
00:20:53,601 --> 00:20:55,432
Oh, God, that's better.

286
00:20:56,103 --> 00:20:58,799
- You on active duty?
- Yes, sir.

287
00:20:58,973 --> 00:21:03,205
- Two bars. Is that lieutenant?
- Two bars is the captain.

288
00:21:05,913 --> 00:21:08,177
You have a loved one in L.A.?

289
00:21:10,618 --> 00:21:13,109
Well, I'm sure he'll be happy to see you.

290
00:21:15,156 --> 00:21:19,183
How long...? How long has it been
since you've been home?

291
00:21:19,593 --> 00:21:21,527
Eleven months.

292
00:21:21,696 --> 00:21:23,664
And how long do you get to stay?

293
00:21:23,831 --> 00:21:25,298
Just till tomorrow.

294
00:21:26,734 --> 00:21:31,000
Wow. Fourteen-hour flight both ways
just for one night.

295
00:21:31,172 --> 00:21:33,106
Wow, that's romantic.

296
00:21:33,274 --> 00:21:36,072
You're a romantic.
I mean, that's quite a gesture.

297
00:21:38,245 --> 00:21:40,236
That's commitment.

298
00:21:45,853 --> 00:21:47,684
You on Facebook?

299
00:21:50,891 --> 00:21:54,486
- I need some chrysanthemums.
- What? You should speak English.

300
00:21:54,662 --> 00:21:57,654
- I had to learn when I came.
- Chrysanthemums and calla lilies.

301
00:21:57,832 --> 00:21:59,857
- I don't know what it...
- Michael, calm down.

302
00:22:00,034 --> 00:22:01,661
What language do you speak in?

303
00:22:01,836 --> 00:22:05,533
I used to speak Bulgarian,
but I'm an American citizen now.

304
00:22:05,706 --> 00:22:08,607
Does anybody here speak English
with a Bulgarian accent?

305
00:22:08,776 --> 00:22:11,040
- Over here. I do.
- There he is.

306
00:22:11,212 --> 00:22:13,646
Bulgarize away. Here we go.

307
00:22:13,814 --> 00:22:16,112
There she is!
The future Mrs. Reed Bennett!

308
00:22:16,283 --> 00:22:18,274
Oh, chrysanthemums.

309
00:22:18,452 --> 00:22:20,647
- Hi, babe.
- Hi, baby.

310
00:22:20,821 --> 00:22:22,880
<i>Hello, fiancée.</i>

311
00:22:23,057 --> 00:22:26,254
It sounds weird. Have you said it yet?
Nikki, take over for a minute.

312
00:22:26,427 --> 00:22:27,621
Come this way.

313
00:22:27,795 --> 00:22:30,958
Wait, these are for you.
I knew they were for somebody.

314
00:22:31,132 --> 00:22:34,101
<i>- Sarah, have you met my fiancée?
- Hi, Morley.</i>

315
00:22:34,268 --> 00:22:38,762
- Hi.
- I just like saying it. I feel so grown-up.

316
00:22:38,939 --> 00:22:40,372
Next, please!

317
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:44,978
- Look what you forgot.
- See, that is...

318
00:22:45,479 --> 00:22:48,448
Is one empty hand.

319
00:22:49,016 --> 00:22:51,610
Oh, yeah.

320
00:22:51,786 --> 00:22:52,980
Don't be mad.

321
00:22:53,154 --> 00:22:55,213
Mad? Why would I be mad?
I'm concerned.

322
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:57,955
Well, just...

323
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:01,754
Do you have any idea what it would be
like at work today if I wore that thing?

324
00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:05,558
- I mean, people will be asking me...
- "Where'd you get the big ring?"

325
00:23:05,733 --> 00:23:09,635
You know, "How many bridesmaids?"
And, "How did he do it?"

326
00:23:09,804 --> 00:23:13,365
- "Gonna have kids? How many?"
- Three.

327
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:17,136
- What?
- Two dogs, and maybe some chickens.

328
00:23:17,311 --> 00:23:20,974
- We can talk about it. We don't have to.
- Sweetheart, I just think right now...

329
00:23:21,148 --> 00:23:25,608
...it would be better if maybe
we could just keep it a secret.

330
00:23:25,953 --> 00:23:27,853
- Where are you from?
- I am from Ruse.

331
00:23:28,022 --> 00:23:31,321
All right, you guys can start
a Bulgarian village together. All right.

332
00:23:31,492 --> 00:23:34,086
Oh, my God, look, there's the bride. Hi.

333
00:23:34,261 --> 00:23:36,923
Listen, I called my BFF, Tony.
He is already on the dress.

334
00:23:37,098 --> 00:23:40,226
He does all the gowns in Vegas.
Cher, Celine, Carrot Top.

335
00:23:40,401 --> 00:23:42,733
This is going to be so much fun!
Oh, my God, it's...

336
00:23:42,903 --> 00:23:45,497
- Breathe, breathe.
- I have to breathe.

337
00:23:45,673 --> 00:23:46,697
Okay.

338
00:23:48,008 --> 00:23:50,875
- See what I mean?
- Yep, I get it.

339
00:23:51,846 --> 00:23:53,074
So...

340
00:23:53,914 --> 00:23:56,382
...Iove is the problem?

341
00:23:57,218 --> 00:23:59,686
- Did you ever have it?
- Oh, yeah.

342
00:24:00,154 --> 00:24:02,384
How old were you when you got it?

343
00:24:02,556 --> 00:24:07,084
Let's see. I'd just started working
at an architectural firm...

344
00:24:07,261 --> 00:24:12,028
...and there was this beautiful young girl,
and she was studying to be an actress.

345
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:14,357
Was your heart kind of going:

346
00:24:16,537 --> 00:24:19,472
Yeah. Yeah, just that way. It went,
bumpada, bumpada, bumpada, boom.

347
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,505
You betcha. Just like that.

348
00:24:21,675 --> 00:24:23,973
One day I got up the courage
to introduce myself.

349
00:24:24,145 --> 00:24:28,605
I walk out, walked right up to her
and opened my mouth and...

350
00:24:28,782 --> 00:24:30,977
...nothing comes out.
- Nothing?

351
00:24:31,152 --> 00:24:36,920
Nothing. Not a peep. But she's just waiting
for me to say something, I'm like a statue.

352
00:24:37,091 --> 00:24:40,959
So finally she says,
"All right, I'll meet you here at 6:30."

353
00:24:41,128 --> 00:24:43,096
She knew what you were going to say.

354
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:48,327
Yep. Yeah. She's been reading my mind
like that for 51 years.

355
00:24:49,236 --> 00:24:51,568
The pretty girl was Grandma, right?

356
00:24:52,273 --> 00:24:55,265
The pretty girl is Grandma, right?

357
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:59,079
- When are we gonna get there, Grandpa?
- Coming up to Moorpark.

358
00:24:59,246 --> 00:25:03,808
Making a left turn right here.
What's Moorpark spelled backwards?

359
00:25:03,984 --> 00:25:06,509
- I don't know.
- "Kraproom."

360
00:25:06,687 --> 00:25:09,622
- Grandpa.
- And don't say that in school.

361
00:25:10,658 --> 00:25:11,989
Hello, Siena Bouquet.

362
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,320
- I'll come with you on runs.
- You got it.

363
00:25:14,495 --> 00:25:16,395
But we gotta hustle. They're flying in now.

364
00:25:16,564 --> 00:25:17,826
I'm always hustling, baby.

365
00:25:17,998 --> 00:25:21,559
No, no, no. Like, "hustle" hustle.
Like, no, don't dilly-dally, okay?

366
00:25:21,735 --> 00:25:23,566
Let me tell you, I don't dilly-dally.

367
00:25:23,737 --> 00:25:25,534
- I only upsy-daisy.
- All right.

368
00:25:27,608 --> 00:25:30,475
<i>When a man loves a woman</i>

369
00:25:31,512 --> 00:25:32,672
Crazy businessman.

370
00:25:32,846 --> 00:25:37,249
This guy, like, he wants to give
family discounts to his 30 cousins.

371
00:25:37,952 --> 00:25:40,546
What is this?
What have you got going...?

372
00:25:43,123 --> 00:25:45,318
Excuse me. Can I help you?

373
00:25:46,627 --> 00:25:49,619
I'd like to send a dozen of those
to the best girl at my school.

374
00:25:49,797 --> 00:25:52,789
- And this musical card.
- A dozen of those with thi...?

375
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,560
This... It's...

376
00:25:58,606 --> 00:26:00,198
Okay.

377
00:26:01,408 --> 00:26:05,811
- All right, where am I sending these to?
- Falcon Crest Elementary.

378
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,208
You can MapQuest it.

379
00:26:07,381 --> 00:26:10,248
I actually know where it's at.
I got a friend that goes there.

380
00:26:10,417 --> 00:26:13,682
Cool. During recess
would be the best time.

381
00:26:13,854 --> 00:26:17,483
When you get there, just hand me
the flowers, and I'll do the rest.

382
00:26:17,658 --> 00:26:21,185
- Okay?
- I'll be there. Thank you, sir.

383
00:26:21,362 --> 00:26:24,058
What's up with the cutest kid in the world
coming in here?

384
00:26:24,231 --> 00:26:28,827
And he shorted me. He just gave me, like,
15 bucks for a $55 arrangement.

385
00:26:29,003 --> 00:26:32,598
- Could I please have my receipt?
- What, did you get audited last year?

386
00:26:32,773 --> 00:26:33,797
I did.

387
00:26:33,974 --> 00:26:37,808
They always get the good guys,
I'm telling you. Here.

388
00:26:38,379 --> 00:26:39,869
Thanks.

389
00:26:44,518 --> 00:26:46,349
So, like, last night, amazing.

390
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,011
This morning,
she couldn't get away fast enough.

391
00:26:49,189 --> 00:26:53,091
Any chance there was a little, shall we say,
disappointment on her part?

392
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:56,696
No. What? No. None.

393
00:26:56,864 --> 00:26:57,956
At all.

394
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:03,293
- Well... No, no, no. It was fine.
- Fine's not good enough, dude.

395
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,961
It was better than fine.
It was a solid A.

396
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:09,106
Minus. B plus, A minus. A minus.

397
00:27:09,276 --> 00:27:11,506
I hate Valentine's Day.

398
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,513
Why can't these guys deliver their
flowers to their girlfriends themselves?

399
00:27:16,183 --> 00:27:18,743
- Wait, what?
- They just dump them in the mailroom.

400
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:22,218
- I mean, if they don't wanna take the time to...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

401
00:27:22,389 --> 00:27:25,256
- It's Valentine's Day today?
- Hello?

402
00:27:25,426 --> 00:27:27,018
Happy Valentine's Day.

403
00:27:27,194 --> 00:27:30,755
Wha...? No, it's a Monday.
Valentine's Day always falls on a Thursday.

404
00:27:30,931 --> 00:27:33,798
That's Thanksgiving, Hoosier-head.

405
00:27:34,134 --> 00:27:38,127
- Really?
- You're 25. You thought that for 25 years?

406
00:27:38,305 --> 00:27:41,570
Dude, he's from Indiana.
They only celebrate Love Your Cousin Day.

407
00:27:41,742 --> 00:27:45,735
No, you're thinking of Kentucky. Of course
Liz was acting weird this morning.

408
00:27:45,913 --> 00:27:48,279
You do have something planned
for tonight, right?

409
00:27:48,449 --> 00:27:52,943
How could I have something planned for
tonight? I didn't even know until right now.

410
00:27:53,554 --> 00:27:57,718
I can do my lunch break,
and I can do after 5?

411
00:27:57,891 --> 00:27:59,984
Okay, great.

412
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,353
No, no, no.
I don't mind people with fetishes.

413
00:28:02,529 --> 00:28:06,124
No, no, no, very creative people.
I gotta put you on hold, sorry.

414
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,892
Good morning.

415
00:28:09,737 --> 00:28:13,503
- You're a strong, confident person.
- Good morning. Who are you?

416
00:28:13,674 --> 00:28:16,609
I am Liz. I am one of the receptionists.
I'm subbing for Monica.

417
00:28:16,777 --> 00:28:19,541
Oh, yeah, Monica,
because she wanted today off.

418
00:28:19,713 --> 00:28:21,340
Shit, she has a life.

419
00:28:21,815 --> 00:28:24,477
She had a funeral, which is a life,
I guess.

420
00:28:24,651 --> 00:28:26,346
Well, Liz, I'm Paula.

421
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,980
I know they call me Bipolar Paula. Don't.
But you should know I'm in crisis.

422
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:33,659
- Okay.
- I don't wanna talk about it.

423
00:28:33,827 --> 00:28:36,022
- Okay.
- It has nothing to do with being alone...

424
00:28:36,196 --> 00:28:38,255
...on Valentine's Day.
- Of course not.

425
00:28:38,432 --> 00:28:42,232
And everything to do with the client
in crisis.

426
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:46,167
- That sounds challenging.
- "Challenging"?

427
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:49,235
Gotta figure out if he still has
an athletic career.

428
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:52,311
If he doesn't, big fat problemo.

429
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:54,640
Well, I'm here
to help you solve that problem.

430
00:28:55,682 --> 00:28:57,343
Who's on hold?

431
00:28:58,318 --> 00:28:59,945
My mother.

432
00:29:00,821 --> 00:29:02,288
I'm sorry.

433
00:29:04,224 --> 00:29:06,522
Hangs up on her own mother.

434
00:29:06,693 --> 00:29:08,422
That's cold.

435
00:29:08,595 --> 00:29:09,687
We might just get along.

436
00:29:26,413 --> 00:29:27,937
<i>Hello, I'm Hannah Storm.</i>

437
00:29:28,115 --> 00:29:30,276
<i>And with football season officially over...</i>

438
00:29:30,451 --> 00:29:33,784
<i>...the only lingering question is:
What will Sean Jackson do?</i>

439
00:29:33,954 --> 00:29:36,889
<i>A devastating loss
in the championship game last week...</i>

440
00:29:37,057 --> 00:29:38,615
<i>...leaves his future in question.</i>

441
00:29:38,792 --> 00:29:41,260
<i>His contract is up, and at age 35...</i>

442
00:29:41,428 --> 00:29:44,397
<i>...he's one of the oldest quarterbacks
in the league.</i>

443
00:29:44,565 --> 00:29:46,032
<i>Does his team want him back?</i>

444
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,260
<i>Of course I want Sean Jackson back.
But it's not my decision.</i>

445
00:29:49,436 --> 00:29:51,802
<i>If not,
will he test the waters of free agency?</i>

446
00:29:53,373 --> 00:29:55,705
<i>Or will he make this easier on
everyone...</i>

447
00:29:55,876 --> 00:29:57,468
<i>...and just retire?</i>

448
00:29:57,644 --> 00:30:00,738
Come on, Hannah. Lighten up.

449
00:30:05,719 --> 00:30:07,380
Hi, neighbor!

450
00:30:07,554 --> 00:30:09,021
- Hey, Sean.
- Hey, girls.

451
00:30:09,189 --> 00:30:11,384
Hey, when are you gonna come over
for a swim?

452
00:30:11,558 --> 00:30:14,550
Oh, sorry, sweetie.
I got lots going on today.

453
00:30:14,728 --> 00:30:18,323
- I'm running out of patience.
- And I'm running out of willpower.

454
00:30:18,499 --> 00:30:21,161
But right now, I gotta make a call.

455
00:30:40,153 --> 00:30:42,519
No. Uh-oh.

456
00:30:42,956 --> 00:30:45,948
Help, Heather!

457
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,154
I'm coming, I'm coming! Yeah, hello?

458
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:50,489
<i>Kara, it's Sean.</i>

459
00:30:50,664 --> 00:30:53,462
Hi, hi. What's going on?
What's going on?

460
00:30:53,634 --> 00:30:57,695
<i>- Media blitz on my career has begun.
- Yes, I know. Are you okay?</i>

461
00:30:57,871 --> 00:31:00,362
Of course I'm okay.
It comes with the territory.

462
00:31:00,541 --> 00:31:03,635
What I'd love is for
my highly paid publicist to take care of it.

463
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:07,507
I'm on it. I've got my people standing by
and a press release ready to go.

464
00:31:07,681 --> 00:31:10,445
- What else?
- I got a meeting with my agent today.

465
00:31:10,617 --> 00:31:13,814
<i>I want you to meet me there
in about an hour. You'll be there?</i>

466
00:31:15,155 --> 00:31:19,717
<i>Hello? Hello? Did I lose you?</i>

467
00:31:20,627 --> 00:31:23,994
<i>Malibu. You pay a fortune to be here to get
crappy cell phone reception.</i>

468
00:31:24,164 --> 00:31:27,133
No, no. I'm here. I'm here.
I'll be at the meeting.

469
00:31:27,301 --> 00:31:29,326
<i>Outstanding.</i>

470
00:31:30,237 --> 00:31:32,034
Drumline, keep your eyes on Scotty.

471
00:31:32,205 --> 00:31:37,006
Registration for the AP exam
is due next week, so don't flake.

472
00:31:38,011 --> 00:31:39,638
Hey, Grace.

473
00:31:39,813 --> 00:31:44,614
I was thinking of putting together
just a little test-prep group for the class...

474
00:31:44,785 --> 00:31:48,346
...and I was hoping I could pick your brain
about what to focus on...

475
00:31:48,522 --> 00:31:52,049
...since you've taken the test,
and I've... I haven't.

476
00:31:52,225 --> 00:31:57,322
- Yeah, yeah. You know, no problem.
- Oh, great. How about today after school?

477
00:31:57,497 --> 00:31:59,931
You know, I can't today.
I nanny after school.

478
00:32:00,634 --> 00:32:03,102
How about today at lunch?

479
00:32:03,604 --> 00:32:06,300
Uh. See, normally that would
work for me...

480
00:32:06,473 --> 00:32:11,672
...but today at lunch, I'm gonna have
sex with my boyfriend for the first time.

481
00:32:11,845 --> 00:32:17,374
- First time having sex for both of us.
- That is quite a special time for you.

482
00:32:17,551 --> 00:32:21,180
It's Valentine's Day,
we're in love, we're both 18...

483
00:32:21,355 --> 00:32:23,380
...and I just want it to be special and...

484
00:32:23,557 --> 00:32:26,492
The point is, my parents work,
so they'll be gone during lunch.

485
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:30,653
Lunch is the only time it can work out.
You know, I'm free tomorrow lunchtime.

486
00:32:30,831 --> 00:32:35,393
- Lunchtime tomorrow, I'll definitely be free.
- Oh, you'll be done having sex by then?

487
00:32:35,702 --> 00:32:38,262
- Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow. It'll be good.
- All right.

488
00:32:38,438 --> 00:32:39,735
Bye.

489
00:32:42,042 --> 00:32:45,068
Come sign
the latte petition. Right here, kids.

490
00:32:45,245 --> 00:32:47,770
- Yeah. Right here.
- Okay.

491
00:32:49,516 --> 00:32:52,178
- You're gonna eat first?
- No.

492
00:32:52,352 --> 00:32:54,843
No? Maybe some Gatorade.

493
00:32:55,022 --> 00:32:57,286
That's... Yeah, I don't wanna
get dehydrated.

494
00:32:57,457 --> 00:33:00,324
- You're not gonna eat lunch?
- No. No lunch.

495
00:33:00,494 --> 00:33:03,930
- Well, did you have a big breakfast?
- No.

496
00:33:04,097 --> 00:33:07,794
Do pushups. I'm telling you,
I do them before I run.

497
00:33:07,968 --> 00:33:13,235
- What? Pushups make you run faster?
- No. Makes you look better.

498
00:33:13,407 --> 00:33:15,375
I'll get you a sandwich
when you come back.

499
00:33:15,542 --> 00:33:18,033
- Yeah, thanks. That's a good idea.
- Save the lattes.

500
00:33:18,211 --> 00:33:21,942
They're putting lattes
in the vending machines? Finally.

501
00:33:22,115 --> 00:33:24,140
- Hey.
- So I'm gonna go to English...

502
00:33:24,317 --> 00:33:26,785
...and then I'm gonna go set up.
- I'll see you there.

503
00:33:26,953 --> 00:33:28,318
All right.

504
00:33:30,457 --> 00:33:31,822
Thank you, Felicia.

505
00:33:31,992 --> 00:33:34,426
Mr. Schwabbe, I'm so glad you're
taking care of this.

506
00:33:34,594 --> 00:33:36,824
- You got it.
- And I like caramel lattes...

507
00:33:36,997 --> 00:33:39,625
...just, like, FYI.
- Duly noted.

508
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,131
Have fun at lunch!

509
00:33:44,538 --> 00:33:46,301
What do you think?

510
00:33:47,574 --> 00:33:48,939
We're gonna wait.

511
00:33:49,109 --> 00:33:51,202
I think we should just, like,
enjoy this time.

512
00:33:51,378 --> 00:33:55,781
- Yeah. Okay. Good.
- Did you like your gift?

513
00:33:55,949 --> 00:33:59,646
- I didn't open it yet.
- You need to open it.

514
00:34:02,122 --> 00:34:04,454
It's... It's my track shirt.

515
00:34:04,624 --> 00:34:08,754
Yeah, but I ironed on your lucky number
on the back.

516
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:10,055
Thirteen.

517
00:34:10,864 --> 00:34:13,196
But that's your lucky number.

518
00:34:13,567 --> 00:34:14,693
You don't even like it.

519
00:34:14,868 --> 00:34:19,532
- No. No, I love it. I can't wait to wear it.
- Okay.

520
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,367
- Try it on now, then.
- Now?

521
00:34:22,542 --> 00:34:23,839
- Yeah.
- Well...

522
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:27,173
...you know, a little uncomfortable
taking my shirt off in public.

523
00:34:28,348 --> 00:34:31,977
- But, hey, I'll wear it later, okay?
- Okay.

524
00:34:32,452 --> 00:34:34,977
Are you gonna carry it around all day?

525
00:34:35,155 --> 00:34:36,520
Shut up.

526
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:38,749
- Let's see if this fits in my locker.
- Right.

527
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:42,322
This is his fifth paternity test.
What are we talking about?

528
00:34:45,932 --> 00:34:49,333
So I spoke with the GM. They passed.

529
00:34:49,503 --> 00:34:50,902
Passed?

530
00:34:51,071 --> 00:34:54,131
We got to the playoffs. I was all-league.

531
00:34:54,307 --> 00:34:57,538
They decided to go another way.
They're chasing that kid from Alabama.

532
00:34:57,711 --> 00:35:00,737
I'm working on a press release
saying it was a mutual parting.

533
00:35:00,914 --> 00:35:05,112
- Well, so now what?
- Well, we... We look for another team.

534
00:35:05,285 --> 00:35:07,845
I don't know. Maybe I'm done.

535
00:35:08,021 --> 00:35:09,784
- You're not done.
- Absolutely not.

536
00:35:09,956 --> 00:35:13,084
And I'm not speaking as someone
who makes a lot of money off of you.

537
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,784
I'm speaking as your fan.

538
00:35:14,961 --> 00:35:19,591
Right now, you can still make
a ton of money doing what you love.

539
00:35:19,766 --> 00:35:23,668
Well, the problem is, Paula,
it's not the only thing I want out of life.

540
00:35:23,837 --> 00:35:26,203
A relationship. Kids.

541
00:35:26,373 --> 00:35:28,568
Well, you can still have that
and play football.

542
00:35:28,742 --> 00:35:31,302
Look, I'm not complaining.
I've been lucky. But...

543
00:35:31,478 --> 00:35:33,742
So, what is he telling me?
What are we gonna do?

544
00:35:34,948 --> 00:35:39,647
I think we should take a beat
and let Sean think about what he wants.

545
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,549
- Right?
- Right.

546
00:35:41,721 --> 00:35:44,212
We have no time for thinking.

547
00:35:45,158 --> 00:35:46,989
Put it on their tab.

548
00:35:49,629 --> 00:35:51,187
- Come on!
- Ha-ha-ha!

549
00:35:51,364 --> 00:35:53,093
- That's seven in a row.
- It's amazing.

550
00:35:53,266 --> 00:35:55,131
You are like... This woman's a shark.

551
00:35:55,302 --> 00:35:57,327
- You are good at this game.
- Not really.

552
00:35:57,504 --> 00:36:02,567
Just witnessed a tactical game of reading
your opponent and adjusting accordingly.

553
00:36:02,742 --> 00:36:05,711
Wait, are you saying
that you're reading me?

554
00:36:07,113 --> 00:36:08,671
Thank you.

555
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:12,783
- Happy Valentine's Day.
- Oh, thank you.

556
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:19,083
Yes, I can read you.
It's part of my training.

557
00:36:19,259 --> 00:36:20,749
Everyone gives subtle hints.

558
00:36:20,927 --> 00:36:22,690
- Hints? Like what?
- Giveaways.

559
00:36:22,863 --> 00:36:25,491
You boarded the plane wearing a suit
but no wedding ring.

560
00:36:25,665 --> 00:36:27,292
Serious, but not committed.

561
00:36:27,467 --> 00:36:29,628
You let a stranger
sleep on your shoulder.

562
00:36:29,803 --> 00:36:33,295
Kindness, but also feels good
to be needed.

563
00:36:33,473 --> 00:36:36,874
The heart-shaped candy.
Another giveaway.

564
00:36:37,744 --> 00:36:40,804
Either you have a problem with sugar,
which, based on the syrup...

565
00:36:40,981 --> 00:36:43,506
...you put on your pancakes,
I wouldn't think so.

566
00:36:43,683 --> 00:36:46,618
Or you have a problem with candy
in the shape of a heart.

567
00:36:46,786 --> 00:36:49,482
Which means you might have a problem
with romance...

568
00:36:49,656 --> 00:36:52,784
...and things pertaining to this day
in particular.

569
00:36:56,463 --> 00:36:58,624
Not bad, soldier.

570
00:36:59,499 --> 00:37:01,433
Okay, Edison. Thank you very much.

571
00:37:01,601 --> 00:37:04,468
Now you all have seen how to properly
place your valentines...

572
00:37:04,638 --> 00:37:07,732
...into our fabulous envelopes,
go ahead. Great.

573
00:37:07,908 --> 00:37:11,810
And while you are doing that quietly,
a little history about Valentine's Day.

574
00:37:11,978 --> 00:37:15,675
Valentine's Day was a massacre in
Chicago where they shot everybody...

575
00:37:15,849 --> 00:37:18,181
...and put a curse on the Chicago Cubs.

576
00:37:19,052 --> 00:37:22,749
Thank you, Franklin, but this
is a different Valentine's Day. Lose the hat.

577
00:37:22,923 --> 00:37:24,823
Okay, in ancient Rome...

578
00:37:24,991 --> 00:37:28,893
...Emperor Claudius II, who was also
known as Claudius the Cruel.

579
00:37:29,763 --> 00:37:32,061
Claudius the Cruel banned all marriages...

580
00:37:32,232 --> 00:37:34,894
...because he wanted his soldiers
to concentrate on war.

581
00:37:35,068 --> 00:37:38,094
But there was a priest who was known
as Valentine...

582
00:37:38,271 --> 00:37:41,832
...who secretly married everyone anyway
because he believed in love.

583
00:37:42,008 --> 00:37:45,341
Claudius found out about the marriages,
and he threw Valentine in jail...

584
00:37:45,512 --> 00:37:47,343
Girls. I'm watching you.

585
00:37:47,514 --> 00:37:48,742
Thank you.

586
00:37:48,915 --> 00:37:52,146
Anyway, on February the 14th,
Valentine wrote a note to his beloved...

587
00:37:52,319 --> 00:37:56,779
...and he signed it:
"Farewell, from your Valentine."

588
00:37:57,924 --> 00:38:01,257
Let's see. Are there any questions?

589
00:38:02,829 --> 00:38:04,922
Franklin, I can't wait to hear this.
Go ahead.

590
00:38:05,532 --> 00:38:08,763
Miss Fitzpatrick,
are you in love with anyone?

591
00:38:13,006 --> 00:38:14,200
I saw you on TV today.

592
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:16,471
- Was it on?
- Yeah, that's why I'm here.

593
00:38:16,643 --> 00:38:18,508
Yes. We're famous!

594
00:38:18,678 --> 00:38:20,441
- Yay, we're famous.
- Yes.

595
00:38:20,613 --> 00:38:22,080
So you're the owner, I take it.

596
00:38:22,248 --> 00:38:25,115
Yeah, tech... Yes.
My grandfather actually started it in Italy.

597
00:38:25,285 --> 00:38:27,719
Yeah, my dad brought it over,
but now I got the shop.

598
00:38:27,887 --> 00:38:29,718
That's great. It's a family business.

599
00:38:29,889 --> 00:38:32,153
Look, I hate to play this card,
but I'm a doctor.

600
00:38:32,325 --> 00:38:35,692
I have surgery in an hour and a half.
Is there any way you could help me?

601
00:38:35,862 --> 00:38:36,954
- Say no more.
- Thank you.

602
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:40,930
Could I get an order form, please,
for the great doctor here?

603
00:38:41,101 --> 00:38:43,126
I need two arrangements.

604
00:38:43,303 --> 00:38:46,636
Something special, long-stemmed roses for
each one of my...

605
00:38:46,806 --> 00:38:48,239
...ladies.

606
00:38:48,675 --> 00:38:50,074
I need your discretion.

607
00:38:50,844 --> 00:38:52,778
We have an understanding, right?

608
00:38:52,946 --> 00:38:54,846
I understand. There's a florist code.

609
00:38:55,015 --> 00:38:58,644
Great. Here's the credit card.
And here are the addresses.

610
00:38:58,818 --> 00:39:01,787
These are the addresses for the ladies.

611
00:39:03,356 --> 00:39:06,291
- Harrison Copeland?
- Yes, you need... You want some ID?

612
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:10,894
Nope. Should be good. Uh...

613
00:39:11,064 --> 00:39:14,500
Okay, this Julia Fitzpatrick,
that would be your...

614
00:39:14,667 --> 00:39:15,691
...girlfriend.

615
00:39:16,536 --> 00:39:20,063
- Yes.
- And this Pamela Copeland...

616
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,936
...it's the same last name as you.
Would that be your wife?

617
00:39:23,109 --> 00:39:24,133
Yes.

618
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:28,440
I thought we had some sort of code,
understanding.

619
00:39:28,615 --> 00:39:32,449
The code is the code. I just wanna
make sure that your understanding...

620
00:39:32,619 --> 00:39:36,111
...is the same understanding
as my understanding. Understand?

621
00:39:36,289 --> 00:39:39,725
- Yeah, can you run the card, please?
- Yep.

622
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,858
Thank you. I have to get my wallet.
I'll be right back.

623
00:40:08,188 --> 00:40:11,589
- Wish me luck.
- All us virgins are pulling for you. Whoo!

624
00:40:11,758 --> 00:40:14,727
If you need any help, text me.

625
00:40:36,382 --> 00:40:38,009
Pushkin.

626
00:40:40,186 --> 00:40:42,518
Good girl. Go play.

627
00:40:50,763 --> 00:40:53,459
Pushkin, no. Downstairs, Pushkin.

628
00:40:58,171 --> 00:40:59,729
One...

629
00:41:17,991 --> 00:41:23,224
<i>Oh, Grace
When I saw your face</i>

630
00:41:45,118 --> 00:41:47,018
<i>Oh, Grace</i>

631
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:53,591
Hey, you. Come on.
Mommy's home for a minute.

632
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,752
Wha...? Come on, sweetie.

633
00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:01,867
<i>Made my heart race
Like a high-speed chase</i>

634
00:42:02,936 --> 00:42:04,597
<i>- Grace
- Grace?</i>

635
00:42:04,771 --> 00:42:05,795
Oh, my...! Alex!

636
00:42:05,972 --> 00:42:09,703
- Holy... Mrs. Smart. Oh, my gosh!
- What are you doing here?

637
00:42:09,876 --> 00:42:13,368
I'm rehearsing!

638
00:42:13,546 --> 00:42:16,982
- Naked?
- Naked! Yes!

639
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:20,483
It's... It's experiment...

640
00:42:20,653 --> 00:42:25,147
I'm doing an... Ow! Experimental show.
It's very, very avant-garde type of thing.

641
00:42:25,325 --> 00:42:28,158
And the... Oh, shit! I mean, excuse me!

642
00:42:28,328 --> 00:42:31,195
- It's okay. I've heard the word before.
- Not shit!

643
00:42:31,364 --> 00:42:34,060
God, look at the time. I gotta go.
Thank you for everything, though.

644
00:42:34,234 --> 00:42:35,258
Ow!

645
00:42:35,435 --> 00:42:36,424
- I'm so sorry!
- It's okay.

646
00:42:36,603 --> 00:42:38,036
- Are you okay?
- Please! Do not come closer.

647
00:42:38,204 --> 00:42:40,638
This does not look right, Alex.

648
00:42:40,807 --> 00:42:43,742
- Thanks for everything and...
- Oh, my God.

649
00:42:44,477 --> 00:42:47,503
- No, Pushkin. Pushkin, no.
- Pushkin. Pushkin.

650
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,671
That's okay.
You know what, I'm gonna just...

651
00:42:49,849 --> 00:42:52,818
All right. Breathe. Oh, my goodness.
All right.

652
00:42:52,986 --> 00:42:56,422
See you very soon, Mrs. Smart! Bye-bye.

653
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,888
MRS. SMART:
Alex, honey, cover your hoo-hoo!

654
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:19,036
- Grace! Grace!
- What are you doing? What happened?

655
00:43:19,212 --> 00:43:21,146
- Mom.
- What, your mom?

656
00:43:21,314 --> 00:43:25,182
- Yeah, sure. My mom was at your house.
- Wha...?

657
00:43:25,351 --> 00:43:28,843
- My mom. What did you say?
- That I was rehearsing.

658
00:43:29,022 --> 00:43:31,320
Naked? Did she buy it?

659
00:43:31,491 --> 00:43:34,949
I think so.
My fear made me very convincing.

660
00:43:35,128 --> 00:43:36,959
I wrote you a song.

661
00:43:38,131 --> 00:43:40,258
If you do that again, Vladimir...

662
00:43:40,433 --> 00:43:44,699
...I will have no choice
but to get down off my horse...

663
00:43:44,871 --> 00:43:48,568
...and punish you.
- Hello? Who wants a valentine?

664
00:43:49,409 --> 00:43:52,606
I am wearing my thigh-high
black leather boots...

665
00:43:52,779 --> 00:43:55,407
...carrying my riding crop.

666
00:43:56,182 --> 00:44:00,084
Now pull down your pants
and bend over.

667
00:44:00,253 --> 00:44:02,619
I think this floor has the most valentines.

668
00:44:02,789 --> 00:44:05,019
What a sweet little pink ass you have.

669
00:44:05,191 --> 00:44:08,126
And I will beat it with my crop...

670
00:44:08,294 --> 00:44:11,889
...until you submit to me,
you filthy peasant.

671
00:44:12,065 --> 00:44:16,263
I will beat it, and beat it,
and beat it, and beat it.

672
00:44:17,904 --> 00:44:19,804
Thank you for calling Naughty Nymphos.

673
00:44:19,972 --> 00:44:22,907
The charge will appear on
your credit card as Vague Entertainment.

674
00:44:23,076 --> 00:44:24,373
Hi there!

675
00:44:24,544 --> 00:44:27,479
Hi. Well, if it isn't the gymnast.

676
00:44:27,647 --> 00:44:30,639
Well... Yes.

677
00:44:31,317 --> 00:44:34,616
To paraphrase some poet:

678
00:44:35,288 --> 00:44:38,155
"There's a hell of a nice universe
next door.

679
00:44:38,458 --> 00:44:41,188
- Let's go."
- E.E. Cummings.

680
00:44:41,361 --> 00:44:43,591
Yeah, E.E. Good stuff. Yeah. Good stuff.

681
00:44:43,763 --> 00:44:45,822
- I think you said he was your favorite.
- Yes.

682
00:44:45,998 --> 00:44:49,365
I did say he was my favorite.
He had me at the font.

683
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:52,902
I feel, like, so stupid for forgetting
that it's Valentine's Day today.

684
00:44:53,072 --> 00:44:56,940
- Oh, no. It's really not a big deal.
- You know what, it is to me.

685
00:44:57,110 --> 00:45:01,308
So can I take you out tonight?

686
00:45:01,748 --> 00:45:05,275
Yes. That would be wonderful. Yes.

687
00:45:05,451 --> 00:45:08,716
- How fast does that cart go?
- Well, let's find out.

688
00:45:10,356 --> 00:45:11,380
Liz...

689
00:45:11,557 --> 00:45:17,018
...there's a man on line 2 asking me to
cover him up in Vaseline and bubble wrap.

690
00:45:17,196 --> 00:45:21,064
I'll take care of that. Damn prank callers.

691
00:45:21,234 --> 00:45:24,829
And he doesn't have a Russian accent,
so I don't think you'll need your horse.

692
00:45:25,004 --> 00:45:26,665
- You heard that?
- It's my phone line.

693
00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:30,707
Oh, Paula. I'm so sorry. I am so sorry.

694
00:45:30,977 --> 00:45:32,501
Am I fired?

695
00:45:32,678 --> 00:45:35,238
It's cool.
You got a way with dirty words, I like that.

696
00:45:35,415 --> 00:45:37,315
Just make sure
you answer my calls first.

697
00:45:37,483 --> 00:45:40,213
Absolutely.
Oh, you do not have to worry about...

698
00:45:40,386 --> 00:45:42,354
...that.

699
00:45:42,889 --> 00:45:44,982
Probably not gonna make
Employee of the Month.

700
00:45:53,766 --> 00:45:56,564
<i>You're listening to
"Mike and Mike in the Morning" on ESPN...</i>

701
00:45:56,736 --> 00:45:58,601
<i>...America's number one
sports talk show.</i>

702
00:45:58,771 --> 00:46:02,002
<i>And, Greeny, the news of the hour:
Sean Jackson, now a free agent.</i>

703
00:46:02,175 --> 00:46:05,008
<i>- What's he supposed to do?
- He can check out Craigslist...</i>

704
00:46:05,178 --> 00:46:06,202
<i>...see who's hiring.</i>

705
00:46:16,556 --> 00:46:19,684
Oh, man. Hey, man, you see this?

706
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:21,918
You did this.
Man, you're gonna pay for this.

707
00:46:22,094 --> 00:46:24,892
Easy, big fella. I know it was my fault.

708
00:46:25,064 --> 00:46:29,433
If you just call my business manager,
he's got all my information.

709
00:46:29,602 --> 00:46:33,732
And I'll have my business manager call
your business manager, okay?

710
00:46:34,707 --> 00:46:39,667
Sean Jackson. Oh, man, my neck.
Oh, and my back.

711
00:46:39,846 --> 00:46:43,475
And my chest. I'm just kidding.

712
00:46:43,649 --> 00:46:46,675
- Whoa, dude, will you sign my hat?
- Sure.

713
00:46:46,853 --> 00:46:49,515
Thirty-five completions,
three touchdowns on the ground.

714
00:46:49,689 --> 00:46:52,385
They think you should hang it up.
That's gratitude for you.

715
00:46:52,558 --> 00:46:53,582
Well, thanks, buddy.

716
00:46:53,759 --> 00:46:57,251
But that door's pretty messed up.
You got another truck?

717
00:46:57,430 --> 00:46:58,761
Yeah, but I'm already behind.

718
00:46:58,931 --> 00:47:02,059
Valentine's Day is kind of a big day
flower-wise.

719
00:47:02,235 --> 00:47:05,864
I don't know why people get flowers
delivered. You can give them yourself.

720
00:47:06,038 --> 00:47:08,165
Some folks like to get flowers
at the workshop.

721
00:47:08,341 --> 00:47:13,005
To some people, love doesn't exist unless
you acknowledge it in front of other people.

722
00:47:14,447 --> 00:47:18,816
You're a superstar, Sean. Drive better.
Whoop!

723
00:47:21,754 --> 00:47:25,815
Yeah, Kara, it's me.
Listen, I know what I wanna do.

724
00:47:25,992 --> 00:47:27,857
I think.

725
00:47:56,956 --> 00:48:00,722
Oh, no, man, not today.

726
00:48:18,778 --> 00:48:19,904
So, what do I do?

727
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:24,379
Do I tell her and break her heart,
or keep it to myself and stay out of it?

728
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:26,916
- It's none of my business.
- You want my opinion?

729
00:48:27,086 --> 00:48:29,213
Yes. No.

730
00:48:29,388 --> 00:48:31,322
Well, it depend... What's your opinion?

731
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:33,981
Ask yourself,
if the situation was reversed...

732
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,718
...what would you want her to do?

733
00:48:37,063 --> 00:48:40,430
- Why you gotta be so sensitive?
- It's because you're so fragile.

734
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:45,833
Okay, so a neutral chlorine atom
has 17 protons and 17 electrons.

735
00:48:46,005 --> 00:48:48,235
And, if these two atoms become...

736
00:48:52,044 --> 00:48:54,842
- Hi.
- This order came into the shop for you.

737
00:48:55,014 --> 00:48:59,974
- I thought I'd deliver it myself.
- Hey, guys, this is my friend, Reed.

738
00:49:00,152 --> 00:49:04,350
- Say hi.
- Hi, Reed.

739
00:49:04,523 --> 00:49:09,187
Take a look at chapter 10, section two.
Just, quietly, to yourselves.

740
00:49:10,396 --> 00:49:13,388
They're from Harrison.
Did he come into the shop? Wow.

741
00:49:14,066 --> 00:49:15,761
Did you meet him?

742
00:49:15,935 --> 00:49:18,529
I kind of need to talk to you.
Do you have a second?

743
00:49:19,405 --> 00:49:20,895
Yeah, sure.

744
00:49:21,073 --> 00:49:23,439
Edison, you're in charge.

745
00:49:28,314 --> 00:49:32,410
- Recess. Let's party.
- Sit down, and be quiet. Got that?

746
00:49:32,585 --> 00:49:34,917
I'm just glad you got to see them.
They're so cute.

747
00:49:35,087 --> 00:49:37,385
- Yeah. They're great.
- Hey, guess what.

748
00:49:37,556 --> 00:49:40,616
I got a flight. I'm leaving at 5:30.
I'll be there by dinner.

749
00:49:40,793 --> 00:49:43,921
You know what, actually,
I don't think it's a good idea.

750
00:49:44,096 --> 00:49:47,327
- Why? It was your idea.
- Well, sometimes I have bad ideas.

751
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,728
It was a genius idea.

752
00:49:48,901 --> 00:49:51,734
- Mr. Bouquet, what about my flowers?
- Is everything okay?

753
00:49:51,904 --> 00:49:55,863
- I gave you $13.
- Oh, right. I remember.

754
00:49:56,042 --> 00:49:59,671
Yeah, they're probably on the truck.
Don't worry, man, they'll be here soon.

755
00:49:59,845 --> 00:50:03,906
Edison, I've known Mr. Bouquet
for a long, long time.

756
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:07,348
If he tells you your flowers are gonna
be here, then they will be here.

757
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,921
Just give me 30 seconds.
Hold down the fort. I'll be right back.

758
00:50:11,323 --> 00:50:13,188
Don't get on the plane.

759
00:50:14,794 --> 00:50:15,818
Why not?

760
00:50:18,698 --> 00:50:20,290
You're sweet.

761
00:50:20,466 --> 00:50:22,457
Is this because Harrison
came into the shop?

762
00:50:23,836 --> 00:50:28,364
And it made you realize that things
could change between us.

763
00:50:28,941 --> 00:50:30,374
No, it's not about me.

764
00:50:30,543 --> 00:50:33,808
Because up to now, all these years,
I've just been there for you.

765
00:50:33,979 --> 00:50:36,004
And with Morley, if she works late...

766
00:50:36,182 --> 00:50:38,742
...if you wanna see a bad movie
she doesn't wanna see...

767
00:50:38,918 --> 00:50:41,910
...or if you wanna have junk food
that she's not gonna have...

768
00:50:42,088 --> 00:50:45,216
...I'm clearly your go-to girl.
- And you're the best.

769
00:50:45,391 --> 00:50:49,384
And now, there's this guy in the mix.
And he's not just a guy...

770
00:50:50,296 --> 00:50:51,627
...he's a man.

771
00:50:51,797 --> 00:50:54,493
- You're afraid he's gonna steal me?
- No. When he came in...

772
00:50:54,667 --> 00:50:56,328
Because, listen, since l...

773
00:50:59,205 --> 00:51:01,173
- I'm your buddy. Don't worry.
- I know.

774
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:02,967
I'm not going anywhere.

775
00:51:05,611 --> 00:51:08,273
But thanks for coming. I'll call you later.

776
00:51:08,447 --> 00:51:10,881
Hey, what's happening in here?
Get back in your seat!

777
00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:12,483
What in the... Stop that.

778
00:51:12,651 --> 00:51:15,882
Get back. That is enough.

779
00:51:16,055 --> 00:51:19,115
Have you lost your minds?
To your seat. That's it, that's it.

780
00:51:19,291 --> 00:51:22,419
I can't talk right now!
I'll have to call you later!

781
00:51:23,395 --> 00:51:25,955
Break it up. Let's go. Come on.

782
00:51:30,369 --> 00:51:33,930
Stop it. Stop looking at me like that.
I tried to tell her.

783
00:51:34,106 --> 00:51:36,131
Not hard enough, Reed.

784
00:51:36,542 --> 00:51:38,703
- You don't know.
- Oh, I don't know?

785
00:51:38,878 --> 00:51:41,210
No, you've never seen her sad.

786
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:44,042
She looks like an abandoned puppy dog
when she cries.

787
00:51:44,216 --> 00:51:45,547
I'm not gonna do that to her.

788
00:51:45,718 --> 00:51:48,710
Especially not today.
I'm not gonna ruin Valentine's Day for her.

789
00:51:48,888 --> 00:51:53,484
I know what day it is. We got a van full
of flowers. At least hurry up. We're behind.

790
00:51:53,659 --> 00:51:55,388
You can't rush love.

791
00:51:55,561 --> 00:52:00,191
I'm gonna drop this off in the bedroom
before Morley gets home. I'll be right back.

792
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,893
He's not gonna hurry.

793
00:52:03,369 --> 00:52:04,393
I'm gonna fish.

794
00:52:14,914 --> 00:52:17,405
- Hey, how was your day?
- Go, go.

795
00:52:17,583 --> 00:52:18,641
- What...?
- Go!

796
00:52:18,818 --> 00:52:19,978
No, wait.

797
00:52:20,152 --> 00:52:24,816
- I want to get out of here.
- Okay, breathe. Like I taught you.

798
00:52:25,291 --> 00:52:26,986
All right, now tell me what's wrong.

799
00:52:27,593 --> 00:52:29,220
She doesn't know I love her.

800
00:52:29,395 --> 00:52:31,989
She didn't get her flowers.
She doesn't know.

801
00:52:32,164 --> 00:52:35,964
I need to make things right.
Will you please help me, Grace? Please?

802
00:52:36,135 --> 00:52:38,899
Of course. But first, soccer.

803
00:52:43,309 --> 00:52:45,334
Hang on. Okay, I can hear you now.

804
00:52:46,912 --> 00:52:50,439
Okay. It's gonna be me all alone
at my own party.

805
00:52:50,616 --> 00:52:54,780
Nobody R.S.V.P.'s. It's L.A. Everyone wants
you to think they have a life.

806
00:52:54,954 --> 00:52:58,048
- I hate you being so in love.
- Oh, I know. Thank you.

807
00:52:58,224 --> 00:53:01,751
Speaking of which, I am going to
San Francisco. Sorry I won't be there.

808
00:53:02,928 --> 00:53:05,795
Whack the heart for me, honey.
I gotta go. Bye.

809
00:53:11,337 --> 00:53:13,828
Carmine, relax. It's me.

810
00:53:15,674 --> 00:53:16,800
- Hey.
- Reed.

811
00:53:18,444 --> 00:53:22,039
What are you doing here? Are you okay?
Is it...?

812
00:53:27,186 --> 00:53:29,120
I'm sorry.

813
00:53:29,288 --> 00:53:31,347
I love you.

814
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:36,022
But I'm just not ready
for this kind of commitment.

815
00:53:36,495 --> 00:53:40,124
And I didn't know that this morning.

816
00:53:43,202 --> 00:53:44,999
No, it's okay.

817
00:53:46,005 --> 00:53:48,496
I shouldn't have rushed it. We can wait.

818
00:53:48,674 --> 00:53:50,801
You didn't do anything wrong.

819
00:53:50,976 --> 00:53:53,877
I shouldn't have been surprised
when you asked.

820
00:53:54,046 --> 00:53:56,947
I should be thinking
about our future together.

821
00:53:57,116 --> 00:53:59,983
But I'm still focused on my future.

822
00:54:01,387 --> 00:54:04,754
Look, you can still have your career,
baby.

823
00:54:04,924 --> 00:54:09,861
We're getting married.
We're not becoming monks or something.

824
00:54:10,029 --> 00:54:14,227
And then there's the whole thing
with my parents' horrible...

825
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,995
Your parents? Wait a second. Just because
your parents had a bad divorce...

826
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:20,798
...does not mean that you're going to have
a bad divorce.

827
00:54:20,973 --> 00:54:24,431
They're not hereditary.
It's not like it's contagious, all right?

828
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:27,201
You're not getting it.

829
00:54:27,379 --> 00:54:31,873
You know, the first phone call I made
after you proposed was to my office.

830
00:54:32,051 --> 00:54:34,383
To confirm my 10:00 meeting.

831
00:54:41,193 --> 00:54:44,162
It's really beautiful.

832
00:54:46,398 --> 00:54:48,366
For someone else.

833
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,367
Don't worry. It's...

834
00:54:58,377 --> 00:55:00,607
Me and Carmine will be fine. Won't we?

835
00:55:00,779 --> 00:55:02,804
Won't we, Carmine?

836
00:55:03,315 --> 00:55:04,646
Right, baby?

837
00:55:08,887 --> 00:55:11,617
Carmine, come. Come here.

838
00:55:15,473 --> 00:55:19,307
Okay, all right. Yeah. Okay...

839
00:55:33,592 --> 00:55:35,651
Did you even consider marrying me?

840
00:55:36,361 --> 00:55:38,420
Of course I did.

841
00:55:39,698 --> 00:55:45,000
But when you ask a girl to marry you,
do you want her to just consider it?

842
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:47,798
Or do you want her to just know?

843
00:55:53,044 --> 00:55:56,070
<i>It's Romeo Midnight, back again.</i>

844
00:55:56,248 --> 00:56:00,082
<i>And if those topsy-turvy feelings
have got you twisted inside-out...</i>

845
00:56:00,252 --> 00:56:03,710
<i>...think of the poet Rumi,
who 800 years ago said:</i>

846
00:56:03,888 --> 00:56:08,222
<i>"All we really want
is love's confusing joy."</i>

847
00:56:08,393 --> 00:56:10,327
<i>Amen, brother.</i>

848
00:56:10,729 --> 00:56:12,720
She was there, huh?

849
00:56:13,231 --> 00:56:14,926
Is that it?

850
00:56:17,736 --> 00:56:19,328
So this, you believe.

851
00:56:19,504 --> 00:56:22,302
You don't buy it
when she says yes to me...

852
00:56:22,574 --> 00:56:24,542
...but when she dumps me...

853
00:56:24,709 --> 00:56:27,303
...that you can wrap your head around.

854
00:56:27,479 --> 00:56:29,208
I had a feeling.

855
00:56:30,282 --> 00:56:32,842
- Excuse me?
- That it wasn't right, Reed.

856
00:56:33,018 --> 00:56:37,011
- Man, you know, an inkling.
- An inkling?

857
00:56:37,756 --> 00:56:42,386
You had an inkling,
and you kept it to yourself?

858
00:56:48,466 --> 00:56:51,867
You don't keep inklings to yourself.
You share them. You're like:

859
00:56:52,037 --> 00:56:53,504
"Hey, guy. I got an inkling...

860
00:56:53,672 --> 00:56:57,130
...you're headed for a fall here."
That's what friends do.

861
00:56:57,309 --> 00:57:00,574
That's common knowledge.
It's in the damn handbook.

862
00:57:01,813 --> 00:57:04,782
I'm sorry, Reed. You're right.

863
00:57:05,517 --> 00:57:07,610
I gotta stop Julia, don't I?

864
00:57:07,786 --> 00:57:11,381
If it's the damn handbook,
I think you better.

865
00:57:13,958 --> 00:57:14,982
Now, let's go.

866
00:57:21,366 --> 00:57:22,856
Next.

867
00:57:23,768 --> 00:57:26,601
I'm going to visit my boyfriend.
I'm surprising him.

868
00:57:26,771 --> 00:57:30,229
- Oh, yeah. Guys love surprises.
- Is that sarcasm?

869
00:57:30,408 --> 00:57:33,775
I surprised my husband once.
Now he's my ex-husband.

870
00:57:33,945 --> 00:57:36,812
- Oh, that sucks...
- Yes. Never touch security, ma'am.

871
00:57:36,981 --> 00:57:39,643
- Yes, ma'am. Copy that.
- Okay.

872
00:57:43,421 --> 00:57:44,547
- Next.
- Have a nice day.

873
00:57:44,723 --> 00:57:46,315
You too, ma'am.

874
00:57:49,728 --> 00:57:53,494
I never had a inkling before.
I didn't know what to do with it.

875
00:57:53,665 --> 00:57:55,530
We gotta get to the airport.

876
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:58,669
- Oh, shit. The flowers.
- Well, I'll deliver them. You go.

877
00:57:58,837 --> 00:58:00,828
I don't have a car. All I have is this van.

878
00:58:01,005 --> 00:58:04,634
My cousin Flaco lives nearby. He's got
a car you can borrow. It's a Chevy.

879
00:58:04,809 --> 00:58:06,106
Yeah?

880
00:58:06,277 --> 00:58:07,972
A hybrid.

881
00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:27,327
Right over there.

882
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:35,997
Guy leaves. I said, "We can't take the dog."
He says, "You know, he'll be right back..."

883
00:58:36,174 --> 00:58:38,938
Hi. I need your first ticket...

884
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:43,740
...out of terminal G to San Francisco.
- This counter for oversized items.

885
00:58:43,915 --> 00:58:46,884
Right. L... But you sell tickets.

886
00:58:47,051 --> 00:58:50,384
- This counter for oversized items.
- But you sell tickets, right?

887
00:58:50,555 --> 00:58:54,924
That counter is for oversized people
this counter is for oversized items, okay?

888
00:58:55,093 --> 00:58:57,254
Okay, here's my luggage.

889
00:58:58,663 --> 00:59:00,426
Now it's a matched set.

890
00:59:00,598 --> 00:59:03,294
Buddy, I'm 52 and I'm wearing
a bright blue shirt to work.

891
00:59:03,468 --> 00:59:07,097
- Please don't make me madder than I am.
- I'm sorry.

892
00:59:10,675 --> 00:59:12,336
- There's this girl.
- Don't tell me...

893
00:59:12,510 --> 00:59:15,172
...that'll take the fun out of guessing.
Gonna be tough.

894
00:59:15,346 --> 00:59:18,543
There's a very pretty girl,
and she's about to get on a big airplane.

895
00:59:18,716 --> 00:59:22,243
And if you don't stop her,
she'll never know how you really feel.

896
00:59:22,921 --> 00:59:24,821
- Not exactly.
- What am I missing?

897
00:59:24,989 --> 00:59:28,015
If she gets on the plane,
she's gonna find out the hard way...

898
00:59:28,193 --> 00:59:31,560
...that the guy
that she thinks she's in love with...

899
00:59:31,729 --> 00:59:35,426
...is a spineless, lying creep.
- That's no good.

900
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,727
No, it is no good,
and I can't let that happen.

901
00:59:37,902 --> 00:59:42,066
Because this girl, she is great.
She's like...

902
00:59:43,174 --> 00:59:44,869
Like sunshine.

903
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:47,905
Everything is better when she's there.

904
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:53,608
I can't stand the idea of some jerk
hurting her. I just can't. I can't.

905
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:56,685
Can you please be quiet...

906
00:59:56,855 --> 01:00:02,054
...so this nice young man
can sell me a ticket. Please?

907
01:00:02,594 --> 01:00:04,391
Take it easy.

908
01:00:04,562 --> 01:00:06,826
Here, this'll get you
to any gate in the place.

909
01:00:06,998 --> 01:00:09,694
- She's like sunshine, huh?
- Yeah.

910
01:00:09,868 --> 01:00:12,735
Well, in that case, it's on me.
Go on, get out of here.

911
01:00:12,904 --> 01:00:14,371
Thank you.

912
01:00:15,006 --> 01:00:16,473
Thank you.

913
01:00:39,364 --> 01:00:42,527
Right this way. Come on. Let me see.

914
01:00:44,636 --> 01:00:46,069
All right.

915
01:00:49,941 --> 01:00:51,806
Hey, sir. Sir.

916
01:00:51,976 --> 01:00:53,944
<i>- Just a moment, sir.
- Attention please.</i>

917
01:00:54,112 --> 01:00:55,807
<i>Flight 464 to San Francisco...</i>

918
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:58,813
<i>...is now boarding at gate 13
in terminal G.</i>

919
01:01:01,019 --> 01:01:05,217
The... The man left his shoes.
Mister, the man forgot his shoes.

920
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:06,721
We've got a Code Foxtrot.

921
01:01:06,891 --> 01:01:09,485
<i>- Excuse me. Excuse me!
- We've got a Code Foxtrot.</i>

922
01:01:11,963 --> 01:01:13,362
Oh, on Mount Tam?

923
01:01:13,531 --> 01:01:16,227
Do you think? Because I heard
there's a little restaurant...

924
01:01:16,401 --> 01:01:19,700
He's a friend of mine. It's okay.
What are you doing?

925
01:01:19,871 --> 01:01:21,998
- Just...
- Where are your shoes? Are you okay?

926
01:01:22,173 --> 01:01:23,299
He's married.

927
01:01:24,676 --> 01:01:27,736
- What?
- Harrison. He's married.

928
01:01:28,813 --> 01:01:30,576
He was married, and now he's divorced.

929
01:01:30,748 --> 01:01:33,842
No. He's still married. Her name is Pamela.
They live in Brentwood.

930
01:01:34,018 --> 01:01:36,145
I know because I delivered flowers to her.

931
01:01:36,588 --> 01:01:38,954
I tried to tell you at the school.

932
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:42,882
Did he say it was his current wife?
"I'm sending flowers to my current wife"?

933
01:01:43,061 --> 01:01:44,585
He didn't have to. I could tell.

934
01:01:44,762 --> 01:01:47,424
Like you could tell
that my old boyfriend Eddie was gay.

935
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:50,261
- Eddie was gay.
- Eddie is married with two beautiful kids.

936
01:01:50,435 --> 01:01:53,165
- Eddie has a cat named Babs.
- You've tried to talk me...

937
01:01:53,338 --> 01:01:57,138
...out of every boyfriend since we've met.
- I'm telling you the truth. I promise.

938
01:01:57,308 --> 01:01:58,536
I'm going.

939
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:01,076
No, hang on, hang on.
Come here, come here.

940
01:02:01,245 --> 01:02:03,338
Why, hello there. I'm with security.

941
01:02:03,514 --> 01:02:05,914
Do you think that Morley
and I belong together?

942
01:02:07,452 --> 01:02:10,387
- What does that have to do with anything?
- Just tell me. Do you?

943
01:02:10,555 --> 01:02:13,251
I don't know.
If you love her and if she loves you...

944
01:02:13,424 --> 01:02:16,052
- Answer the question.
- Fine.

945
01:02:17,829 --> 01:02:19,262
No.

946
01:02:20,498 --> 01:02:23,558
- Personally, I don't see it.
- That's what I'm doing here.

947
01:02:23,735 --> 01:02:26,533
Because apparently everyone
and their mother felt that way...

948
01:02:26,704 --> 01:02:28,638
...but nobody had the guts to tell me.

949
01:02:29,407 --> 01:02:32,672
And now, I'm left with some stupid ring
and an empty closet...

950
01:02:32,844 --> 01:02:37,781
...and an ache in my gut the size of Texas
because nobody told me.

951
01:02:38,816 --> 01:02:41,751
- She left you.
- Today.

952
01:02:44,789 --> 01:02:45,915
I'm sorry.

953
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:51,153
This will serve as your final boarding call
for flight 464 to San Francisco.

954
01:03:03,241 --> 01:03:07,837
- I don't want this to happen to you.
- I'm sorry about Morley...

955
01:03:08,379 --> 01:03:10,142
...but I'm going to see my boyfriend.

956
01:03:10,748 --> 01:03:12,648
You know it's the truth.

957
01:03:17,121 --> 01:03:19,021
Sir, your shoes are still at security.

958
01:03:19,857 --> 01:03:21,654
We're not allowed to touch them.

959
01:03:21,826 --> 01:03:26,593
Sir, what kind of man takes his shoes off
and leave them off in public?

960
01:03:26,764 --> 01:03:29,699
Now, you know,
it's some nasty stuff on these floors, sir.

961
01:03:41,512 --> 01:03:42,979
Whoa.

962
01:03:45,616 --> 01:03:47,106
Sorry.

963
01:03:58,529 --> 01:04:02,192
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure
you've noticed we're experiencing turbulence.</i>

964
01:04:02,366 --> 01:04:05,233
<i>Nothing to be concerned about
but the captain has turned on...</i>

965
01:04:05,402 --> 01:04:06,926
<i>...the seat belt sign for safety.</i>

966
01:04:07,104 --> 01:04:09,766
<i>Please return to your seats
until we pass through this...</i>

967
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:12,773
<i>...which should be in just a few minutes.
- Yeah.</i>

968
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:14,543
- Yeah.
- I'll just put it there.

969
01:04:14,711 --> 01:04:16,269
Watch your hands.

970
01:04:20,918 --> 01:04:22,476
You look very pretty.

971
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:24,878
Thank you.

972
01:04:25,189 --> 01:04:26,213
- Are you nervous?
- Yes.

973
01:04:26,390 --> 01:04:29,655
No reason to be. The minute you walk
through that door nothing else...

974
01:04:29,827 --> 01:04:30,885
...is gonna matter.

975
01:04:31,462 --> 01:04:32,929
Thank you.

976
01:04:35,365 --> 01:04:37,856
Franklin rules!

977
01:04:39,369 --> 01:04:41,394
Hey, Edison, wanna warm up together?

978
01:04:41,572 --> 01:04:44,735
Yeah, Edison.
Warm up with your girlfriend.

979
01:04:44,908 --> 01:04:47,206
Grow up, Franklin.

980
01:04:48,312 --> 01:04:50,439
Are you gonna watch
Discovery Channel tonight?

981
01:04:50,614 --> 01:04:53,139
- It's about giraffes.
- No, I can't.

982
01:04:53,317 --> 01:04:55,217
I have to work at my mother's restaurant.

983
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,447
- The one with the pointy towers?
- Yeah.

984
01:04:58,622 --> 01:05:00,351
I went there for your birthday party.

985
01:05:00,891 --> 01:05:04,122
It's a busy night for us. We have a wedding,
and a party for people...

986
01:05:04,294 --> 01:05:05,784
...who hate Valentine's Day.

987
01:05:06,263 --> 01:05:09,357
- Why hate Valentine's Day?
- I don't know.

988
01:05:09,533 --> 01:05:12,798
We have it every year,
and it's all of Miss Fitzpatrick's friends.

989
01:05:12,970 --> 01:05:14,198
Really?

990
01:05:14,872 --> 01:05:16,965
Not in Franklin's house!

991
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:19,233
Come on, the game's starting!

992
01:05:28,118 --> 01:05:31,053
- Edison, what the heck is wrong with you?
- I'm in love.

993
01:05:31,221 --> 01:05:33,951
So am I, but I can move my feet.

994
01:05:41,665 --> 01:05:44,828
Did you see it?
I went like this with my head.

995
01:05:45,002 --> 01:05:48,961
I kicked the ball with my head!
Didn't you see it?

996
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:54,641
Oh, I did see it, honey.
Mommy's so proud of you.

997
01:05:55,445 --> 01:05:57,504
Let's go find Daddy.

998
01:06:01,051 --> 01:06:04,145
I'm Kelvin Moore. Happy Valentine's Day.

999
01:06:04,321 --> 01:06:06,186
Welcome to the famous Hollywood Stars...

1000
01:06:06,356 --> 01:06:07,846
Don't you know who I am, huh?

1001
01:06:08,025 --> 01:06:10,653
- You think I wouldn't find you here?
- What are you doing?

1002
01:06:10,827 --> 01:06:12,886
- I'm trying to work.
- Look at this, everyone!

1003
01:06:13,063 --> 01:06:15,531
This is not in... This isn't for pictures.

1004
01:06:15,699 --> 01:06:18,668
Miss. Oh, mother, what's going on?
Why so...?

1005
01:06:18,835 --> 01:06:20,769
"Cisco Martinez is a cheating rat."

1006
01:06:20,938 --> 01:06:23,304
<i>She's loco.
I don't know what she's talking about.</i>

1007
01:06:23,473 --> 01:06:27,341
<i>- No, rata. You rata!
- Cisco! Cisco!</i>

1008
01:06:27,511 --> 01:06:30,446
- What are you doing? This is...
- Oh, she kneed him in the gonads.

1009
01:06:30,614 --> 01:06:32,775
My goodness, I feel for you.
The Dodger Dog.

1010
01:06:32,950 --> 01:06:34,383
- I'm okay.
- Sleeping with them?

1011
01:06:34,551 --> 01:06:36,143
Anyway, my name is Kelvin Moore.

1012
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,413
Happy Valentine's Day.
KVLA, channel 13.

1013
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:41,480
We done?

1014
01:06:42,726 --> 01:06:45,286
Got a text. Sean Jackson
is calling a press conference.

1015
01:06:45,462 --> 01:06:48,192
This could be my exclusive, okay?
Listen, keep filming.

1016
01:06:48,365 --> 01:06:51,357
All right, do some B-roll
or something like that, all right?

1017
01:06:51,835 --> 01:06:53,632
No worries, boss.

1018
01:06:55,706 --> 01:06:57,697
It's my day.

1019
01:06:58,675 --> 01:07:01,576
Hey, listen, I need to be able
to talk to Kara for two seconds.

1020
01:07:01,745 --> 01:07:05,078
I already gave you everything on the
press conference, so we are good.

1021
01:07:05,248 --> 01:07:09,207
I'm trying to do something special.
Look at the profile. I'm from KVLA.

1022
01:07:09,386 --> 01:07:11,820
- The number two sports guy.
- On my way to number one.

1023
01:07:11,989 --> 01:07:14,423
I wanted to ask her one question
about Sean Jackson.

1024
01:07:14,591 --> 01:07:17,583
I need to be able to ask Sean Jackson
one question on camera.

1025
01:07:17,761 --> 01:07:19,854
She's on a conference call,
she's very busy.

1026
01:07:20,030 --> 01:07:21,691
- I don't know if I can...
- My bladder.

1027
01:07:21,865 --> 01:07:24,891
I gotta use the bathroom. Got a bathroom?
Oh, I dropped my notes.

1028
01:07:25,068 --> 01:07:28,094
- No. You can't just barge into an... Kara.
- Kara.

1029
01:07:28,271 --> 01:07:30,501
- Damn.
- Oh, Kara. Are you okay?

1030
01:07:30,674 --> 01:07:33,871
- Oh, do I look okay?
- Should we call a doctor?

1031
01:07:34,044 --> 01:07:35,409
No, it's this day.

1032
01:07:35,579 --> 01:07:38,013
Christmas, New Year's, Fourth of July,
she's fine.

1033
01:07:38,181 --> 01:07:42,083
- Valentine's Day, not so good.
- What are you doing tonight, Kelvin?

1034
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:47,713
I'm actually here about the Sean Jackson
interview, but we could talk.

1035
01:07:47,891 --> 01:07:52,351
Relax, I'm not asking you out.
I'm just curious.

1036
01:07:52,529 --> 01:07:57,762
How are you spending
this happiest of all days?

1037
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:00,530
- Let me just...
- You don't wanna call somebody?

1038
01:08:00,704 --> 01:08:02,899
I just wanna know if, in fact...

1039
01:08:03,073 --> 01:08:07,567
...I am the only person
on the whole freaking planet...

1040
01:08:07,744 --> 01:08:13,046
...who is completely
and 100-percent alone on Valentine's Day.

1041
01:08:13,984 --> 01:08:15,281
I asked you a question.

1042
01:08:16,019 --> 01:08:18,044
Yeah. I'm working.

1043
01:08:18,622 --> 01:08:20,988
9, 10, and 11:00.

1044
01:08:21,158 --> 01:08:25,424
Usually, I do two, but people want it off,
so I'm happy to cover for them on this day.

1045
01:08:25,862 --> 01:08:28,092
You don't like to go out
on Valentine's Day?

1046
01:08:28,265 --> 01:08:30,631
- I hate it.
- Me too.

1047
01:08:31,134 --> 01:08:34,365
It's my fault I'm alone.
I'm neurotic to the nth degree.

1048
01:08:34,538 --> 01:08:36,301
I don't have time to work on myself...

1049
01:08:36,473 --> 01:08:38,964
...because I'm too busy
fixing everyone else.

1050
01:08:39,142 --> 01:08:41,702
- Right.
- My closest relationship...

1051
01:08:41,878 --> 01:08:43,573
...is with my BlackBerry.

1052
01:08:43,747 --> 01:08:45,806
- Right.
- Thank God it vibrates.

1053
01:08:45,982 --> 01:08:47,449
- Oh, no.
- But do you know...

1054
01:08:47,617 --> 01:08:49,881
...who has always been there for me?
- Who's that?

1055
01:08:50,053 --> 01:08:53,989
- Candy.
- There's somebody.

1056
01:08:54,524 --> 01:08:57,152
I cannot get enough.
And I know it's bad...

1057
01:08:57,327 --> 01:08:58,555
- Kara.
...but I need it.

1058
01:08:58,729 --> 01:09:01,527
I need it, and there is not a shortage
on Valentine's Day.

1059
01:09:01,698 --> 01:09:03,427
And that is my future.

1060
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:07,127
I'll be a Ionely old lady
with rotting teeth.

1061
01:09:07,304 --> 01:09:10,273
- No, no, no. No, you're not.
- And a chocolate mustache.

1062
01:09:15,779 --> 01:09:18,247
Okay, maybe you should try some tofu
or something.

1063
01:09:18,415 --> 01:09:21,851
Okay. It'll balance out your emotions.

1064
01:09:22,052 --> 01:09:24,247
I don't want a mustache.

1065
01:09:25,455 --> 01:09:27,047
You'll look hot with a mustache.

1066
01:09:27,691 --> 01:09:30,489
Or without it. It doesn't matter.

1067
01:09:39,069 --> 01:09:43,028
- You can let go of me now.
- Yeah, I should.

1068
01:09:43,206 --> 01:09:45,640
- Well, I guess we're done here.
- All right.

1069
01:09:45,809 --> 01:09:47,071
You can check with Heather.

1070
01:09:47,244 --> 01:09:49,872
- She'll validate your parking.
- You have a blessed day.

1071
01:09:52,382 --> 01:09:54,009
<i>On your mark.</i>

1072
01:09:54,184 --> 01:09:55,344
Get set.

1073
01:10:00,123 --> 01:10:02,751
I'm Greg Gilkins at
my old high school, Henderson High...

1074
01:10:02,926 --> 01:10:04,723
...and today's subject: Young love.

1075
01:10:04,895 --> 01:10:08,854
I'm joined by Felicia, whose boyfriend,
Willy, will be joining us shortly.

1076
01:10:09,032 --> 01:10:12,433
- Felicia, if he's the star athlete, you are...?
- Not the cheerleader.

1077
01:10:12,602 --> 01:10:15,833
- I'm on the dance team.
- Maybe you could show us a little bit.

1078
01:10:16,006 --> 01:10:17,871
Five, six, seven, eight.

1079
01:10:24,214 --> 01:10:26,273
Don't hurt yourself.

1080
01:10:26,449 --> 01:10:28,280
- Yes.
- I haven't seen moves like that...

1081
01:10:28,451 --> 01:10:31,750
...since the '94 Northridge quake.
You guys are...

1082
01:10:34,991 --> 01:10:37,459
How do you feel about each other
this Valentine's Day?

1083
01:10:37,627 --> 01:10:40,221
- Oh, my gosh. I totally love him.
- I'm crazy about her.

1084
01:10:40,397 --> 01:10:42,865
Willy, what is it about her
that makes you so happy?

1085
01:10:43,033 --> 01:10:46,161
Well, she's beautiful,
she makes me laugh...

1086
01:10:46,336 --> 01:10:48,270
...and she does my geometry.
- Bonus.

1087
01:10:48,438 --> 01:10:49,462
- Yep.
- And, Felicia...

1088
01:10:49,639 --> 01:10:51,539
...what is it about Willy that's so cool?

1089
01:10:51,708 --> 01:10:55,508
What, besides the fact that he's totally hot?
He's an amazing athlete.

1090
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:57,806
Go show them, babe.
Go show them, go show them.

1091
01:10:57,981 --> 01:10:59,915
He's so good.

1092
01:11:03,486 --> 01:11:07,923
How about this? I cook her dinner and then
serve it to her in front of a fireplace.

1093
01:11:08,091 --> 01:11:10,559
- That says romance.
- That says cheap-o.

1094
01:11:10,727 --> 01:11:11,751
Okay, not a problem.

1095
01:11:11,928 --> 01:11:14,556
I got her tickets to the movie
at the Hollywood Cemetery.

1096
01:11:14,731 --> 01:11:17,063
Oh, yeah. Chicks love the cemetery...

1097
01:11:17,234 --> 01:11:20,135
...on Valentine's Day.
- Don't you think you should get a gift?

1098
01:11:20,303 --> 01:11:24,000
Gift? I'm supposed to get her a Prius?
We've been dating for like two weeks.

1099
01:11:24,741 --> 01:11:26,265
Is there a two-week gift?

1100
01:11:26,443 --> 01:11:28,843
If you want there to be a third week
there is.

1101
01:11:29,012 --> 01:11:31,606
- So how did you guys meet?
- It's really funny, actually.

1102
01:11:31,781 --> 01:11:33,373
Like, I was not into him at first.

1103
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:35,950
He used to shoot spit wads at me
in Spanish class...

1104
01:11:36,119 --> 01:11:37,746
...which is, like, so junior high.

1105
01:11:38,688 --> 01:11:41,623
But then one night I was brushing out
my hair when I got home...

1106
01:11:41,791 --> 01:11:44,783
...and I found this spit wad,
but it was really a note.

1107
01:11:44,961 --> 01:11:48,795
And it said, "What's up?"
And I was like, "That is so cute."

1108
01:11:48,965 --> 01:11:49,989
And then I liked him.

1109
01:11:57,507 --> 01:12:01,204
Oh, my God. Baby, are you okay?
Walk it off, baby. Just walk it off.

1110
01:12:02,312 --> 01:12:04,872
You're still hot, baby. You're still hot.

1111
01:12:05,048 --> 01:12:08,074
- He rolled out of that like a ninja.
- He's usually good at those.

1112
01:12:08,251 --> 01:12:10,685
He's quite the athlete,
you're quite the dancer, huh?

1113
01:12:10,854 --> 01:12:14,790
- Five, six, seven, eight!
- No, I think... I think we're okay.

1114
01:12:14,958 --> 01:12:17,324
Oh, we haven't seen that one.

1115
01:12:17,661 --> 01:12:20,129
- Way to go. She tell you the spit-wad story?
- She did.

1116
01:12:20,297 --> 01:12:22,265
- Yeah, she's mushy like that.
- You like it.

1117
01:12:22,432 --> 01:12:24,627
- I know.
- Oh, I miss high school.

1118
01:12:25,602 --> 01:12:28,503
There you have it, young love.
Full of promise, full of hope...

1119
01:12:28,672 --> 01:12:31,766
...ignorant of reality. From Henderson High
on Valentine's Day, I'm Greg Gilkins.

1120
01:12:33,843 --> 01:12:34,935
Okay.

1121
01:12:35,111 --> 01:12:38,046
Sorry, Mr. E., but they can't get your
flowers delivered today...

1122
01:12:38,214 --> 01:12:42,651
...but they'll figure it out tomorrow.
- No, it has to be today. It has to.

1123
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:46,956
Oh, just let him go.
Let him go, let him go, let him go.

1124
01:12:47,123 --> 01:12:51,219
I'll tell you, today's a lot of pressure for
anyone, let alone a little kid. Come on.

1125
01:12:51,995 --> 01:12:55,431
Tell me about it. I haven't been having
the best day myself.

1126
01:12:59,235 --> 01:13:01,499
Is everything okay with Alex?

1127
01:13:01,671 --> 01:13:04,697
- Not really.
- Uh-oh. What happened?

1128
01:13:06,209 --> 01:13:09,610
Alex and I were supposed to...

1129
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:11,004
...have sex today.

1130
01:13:13,683 --> 01:13:15,878
For the first time. For both of us.

1131
01:13:17,053 --> 01:13:19,920
I wanted it to be magical,
and I'm realizing that...

1132
01:13:20,090 --> 01:13:22,615
...it's hard to plan something
to be magical, you know?

1133
01:13:22,792 --> 01:13:26,694
- Yes, that it is.
- Love can't be planned.

1134
01:13:26,863 --> 01:13:29,764
It's not love she is talking about, Edgar.
It is sex.

1135
01:13:29,933 --> 01:13:31,195
He's going to Stanford.

1136
01:13:31,368 --> 01:13:34,963
I'm going to Yale.
And it's just hit me recently that...

1137
01:13:35,138 --> 01:13:37,265
...it's gonna be really hard
to stay together.

1138
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:41,342
So I guess I thought that if we had
this amazing thing connecting us...

1139
01:13:41,511 --> 01:13:44,207
...it'd make it easier, somehow,
but I don't know...

1140
01:13:44,381 --> 01:13:47,646
...hearing myself say it out loud,
it all sounds really stupid.

1141
01:13:47,817 --> 01:13:51,651
And it's not like I'm gonna sleep with
one person for the rest of my life, right?

1142
01:13:51,821 --> 01:13:53,721
I mean, that's just crazy. Who does that?

1143
01:13:53,890 --> 01:13:58,554
- Oh, crazy people like us. We did.
- No.

1144
01:14:00,330 --> 01:14:04,664
- That's amazing.
- Well, granted, it was a different time...

1145
01:14:04,834 --> 01:14:08,463
...and people weren't as promiscuous
as they are now.

1146
01:14:08,638 --> 01:14:11,971
And there were times we spent
long periods apart, but we managed.

1147
01:14:12,142 --> 01:14:16,044
I'm not saying it was easy
or suggesting it for you.

1148
01:14:16,212 --> 01:14:18,407
Just saying it's possible.

1149
01:14:18,581 --> 01:14:22,142
And actually, we're gonna renew our vows
this spring, right?

1150
01:14:26,890 --> 01:14:30,121
- Would you excuse us a minute?
- Yeah. I'm gonna take this.

1151
01:14:30,827 --> 01:14:35,059
Hey. No, I'm just at Edgar and Estelle's.
What are you doing?

1152
01:14:37,767 --> 01:14:41,567
Alex, I gotta tell you something.

1153
01:14:41,738 --> 01:14:43,763
I don't know if today's the day.

1154
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:46,374
I want it to be special,
you want it to be special...

1155
01:14:46,543 --> 01:14:50,946
...and, you know, we tried
to make it special, but, you know...

1156
01:14:51,514 --> 01:14:54,745
Do you wanna go back there and see
my mom after what happened earlier?

1157
01:14:54,918 --> 01:14:56,317
I don't think so.

1158
01:14:58,955 --> 01:15:02,186
All right, well, okay.

1159
01:15:02,358 --> 01:15:03,825
Um...

1160
01:15:03,993 --> 01:15:06,484
You know what, Alex, sorry.
I need to call you back.

1161
01:15:06,663 --> 01:15:08,631
I have to go. I'll call you later. Bye.

1162
01:15:13,036 --> 01:15:14,060
Edison!

1163
01:15:32,222 --> 01:15:36,591
Remember when you went away
to Florida to build the apartments?

1164
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:39,593
You remember that.
And you were gone a very long time.

1165
01:15:39,763 --> 01:15:41,025
Yes.

1166
01:15:41,731 --> 01:15:44,029
You were gone so long.

1167
01:15:44,367 --> 01:15:46,028
I was so Ionely.

1168
01:15:47,537 --> 01:15:49,334
And...

1169
01:15:49,506 --> 01:15:54,876
Well, Joey came over. It was my birthday,
and he brought flowers, and...

1170
01:15:55,044 --> 01:15:57,877
- I sent you flowers, hon.
- Yes, you did.

1171
01:15:58,047 --> 01:16:00,174
And champagne.

1172
01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:02,341
Joey? Wait a minute.

1173
01:16:02,519 --> 01:16:04,282
- Joey Keenan?
- Yes.

1174
01:16:04,454 --> 01:16:06,718
- My business partner.
- That's right.

1175
01:16:08,391 --> 01:16:11,189
And we sat and we talked
and we had dinner, and we...

1176
01:16:12,762 --> 01:16:14,593
And then...

1177
01:16:16,466 --> 01:16:19,299
It wasn't anything at first. And...

1178
01:16:19,469 --> 01:16:23,872
- You had an affair.
- Yes. But it didn't last long, Edgar.

1179
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:27,305
Didn't last long,
and we regretted it very much.

1180
01:16:27,477 --> 01:16:29,468
I'm so sorry.

1181
01:16:35,118 --> 01:16:39,054
- You're the only man I've ever loved.
- Then why tell me now?

1182
01:16:39,222 --> 01:16:42,714
It's been bothering me.
Our vows and everything.

1183
01:16:42,892 --> 01:16:45,156
And I wanted to tell you the truth.

1184
01:16:45,795 --> 01:16:47,820
The truth?

1185
01:16:50,166 --> 01:16:52,498
Well, unfortunately, Estelle...

1186
01:16:52,669 --> 01:16:56,196
...the truth makes everything else
seem like a lie.

1187
01:16:57,807 --> 01:16:59,468
I'm sorry.

1188
01:17:09,752 --> 01:17:11,686
<i>Why do you hate heart-shaped candy?</i>

1189
01:17:11,855 --> 01:17:16,952
I think it's because it reminds me that this
is Valentine's Day, and I'm recently single.

1190
01:17:17,227 --> 01:17:19,058
- We weren't on the same page.
- Sorry.

1191
01:17:19,229 --> 01:17:22,494
- It's okay. It's over.
- Nothing to be done?

1192
01:17:22,665 --> 01:17:25,657
No, no. I've seen the enemy
and the enemy is me.

1193
01:17:25,835 --> 01:17:28,531
You could go for the stewardess.
She seems to like you.

1194
01:17:29,038 --> 01:17:31,029
I think she likes everybody,
that's her job.

1195
01:17:31,207 --> 01:17:33,767
She looks over here every 5 seconds.

1196
01:17:33,943 --> 01:17:35,808
- No.
- Ready?

1197
01:17:35,979 --> 01:17:38,277
- Five, four, three...
- You wanna bet on it?

1198
01:17:38,448 --> 01:17:40,939
- I'll bet you a bag of pretzels.
- Okay.

1199
01:17:41,117 --> 01:17:43,210
Five, four, three, two...

1200
01:17:43,386 --> 01:17:46,480
- Oh, there it is.
- Okay. All right, that was a coincidence.

1201
01:17:46,656 --> 01:17:49,318
- Five, four, three...
- Stop it. Stop it.

1202
01:17:49,492 --> 01:17:52,825
- Looked on three. She's gonna come here.
- Excuse me.

1203
01:17:52,996 --> 01:17:56,488
- Can I get you anything?
- A bag of pretzels, please.

1204
01:17:57,533 --> 01:17:59,262
Two, actually.

1205
01:18:13,216 --> 01:18:17,346
Thank you for the flowers, Mr. Troken.
Ready for your sponge bath?

1206
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,488
Yes, please.

1207
01:18:28,464 --> 01:18:31,126
Hi, excuse me. Hi.

1208
01:18:31,301 --> 01:18:33,326
Could I ask you a question?

1209
01:18:33,503 --> 01:18:36,301
I'm looking for Dr. Copeland.
Is he here tonight?

1210
01:18:36,472 --> 01:18:40,238
- Not tonight, no.
- Sorry, Dr. Harrison Copeland.

1211
01:18:40,410 --> 01:18:42,173
Not tonight.

1212
01:18:42,879 --> 01:18:47,543
- Could you tell me where I could find him?
- Are you a patient? Is something wrong?

1213
01:18:52,922 --> 01:18:57,018
Look, can I ask you a question,
just woman to woman?

1214
01:18:58,394 --> 01:18:59,952
Okay.

1215
01:19:03,967 --> 01:19:06,197
Is Dr. Copeland married?

1216
01:19:07,103 --> 01:19:08,730
Not divorced or not separated...

1217
01:19:08,905 --> 01:19:12,534
...just full-on married
to a woman named Pamela?

1218
01:19:16,346 --> 01:19:19,110
They just celebrated
their 15th anniversary.

1219
01:19:21,184 --> 01:19:22,879
Cardiology Center.

1220
01:19:26,923 --> 01:19:29,915
Los Angeles Hospital, may I help you?

1221
01:19:31,627 --> 01:19:34,596
Bistro Garden, early seating.

1222
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:46,070
Kara, I'm still here. I'm in L.A.

1223
01:19:46,242 --> 01:19:48,233
I have a lot to tell you. Give me a call.

1224
01:19:49,479 --> 01:19:52,141
May I have your attention, please?
I'm Sean's publicist...

1225
01:19:52,315 --> 01:19:55,512
...and recently there has been a lot of
speculation about his future.

1226
01:19:55,685 --> 01:19:59,849
And rather than keep you all in suspense,
he will make a brief statement at this time.

1227
01:20:03,159 --> 01:20:05,787
- Hey, boss. Sorry, elevator took a year.
- Cleaning up?

1228
01:20:05,962 --> 01:20:07,520
- I'm trying to be you.
- All right.

1229
01:20:07,697 --> 01:20:09,961
First off, I'd like to thank everyone
for coming.

1230
01:20:10,133 --> 01:20:13,864
I know it's Valentine's Day and you might
have other plans, so I'll be quick.

1231
01:20:14,037 --> 01:20:15,595
<i>The cliché...</i>

1232
01:20:15,772 --> 01:20:18,935
<i>...when someone's retiring
who doesn't wanna retire...</i>

1233
01:20:19,108 --> 01:20:22,908
...is to say that it's because they wanna
spend more time with their family.

1234
01:20:23,079 --> 01:20:28,073
I don't have a family,
and with everything football has given me...

1235
01:20:28,518 --> 01:20:32,079
...the biggest thing it's taken away is that.

1236
01:20:32,255 --> 01:20:35,622
Because of who I am...

1237
01:20:35,925 --> 01:20:37,051
...because of my job...

1238
01:20:37,226 --> 01:20:40,821
...I haven't been able to live the life
I want to.

1239
01:20:40,997 --> 01:20:44,831
With that in mind, I'll just say the thing
I came here to say.

1240
01:20:46,202 --> 01:20:47,362
I'm gay.

1241
01:20:50,106 --> 01:20:51,130
I knew it!

1242
01:20:51,307 --> 01:20:53,138
- Any questions?
- Are you kidding me?

1243
01:20:53,309 --> 01:20:56,540
And be cool, because I'm not above
kicking anybody's ass.

1244
01:20:56,712 --> 01:20:58,680
Sean, you for real?

1245
01:20:59,315 --> 01:21:02,011
Uh, first question.

1246
01:21:02,618 --> 01:21:04,848
Sean, come on, help me out.

1247
01:21:05,621 --> 01:21:06,986
Kelvin Moore, KVLA.

1248
01:21:07,757 --> 01:21:10,749
Sean, I'm confused here.
Are you saying that you're retiring?

1249
01:21:10,927 --> 01:21:13,361
Oh, right, that.

1250
01:21:14,497 --> 01:21:18,263
No, Kelvin. No, I'm not retiring.

1251
01:21:18,601 --> 01:21:21,263
I'm gay, and I'm gonna play.

1252
01:21:32,381 --> 01:21:35,578
Pick up the phone, Estelle. Edgar.

1253
01:21:39,222 --> 01:21:41,520
- Rosato martini with soda, table six.
- You got it.

1254
01:21:41,691 --> 01:21:46,287
<i>I'm not really a waitress, I'm an actress.
I just did a day on Days of Our Lives.</i>

1255
01:21:47,096 --> 01:21:50,224
- Happy Valentine's Day.
- Happy Valentine's to you.

1256
01:21:50,399 --> 01:21:52,196
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

1257
01:21:54,637 --> 01:21:56,730
- Thank you.
- Olivia's gonna need braces.

1258
01:21:56,906 --> 01:21:57,964
Well, that makes sense.

1259
01:21:58,141 --> 01:22:00,473
- I had them, you had them.
- I know.

1260
01:22:02,945 --> 01:22:04,572
Bistro Gardens restaurant.

1261
01:22:05,348 --> 01:22:06,372
Good evening.

1262
01:22:09,485 --> 01:22:11,282
- Hi.
- Harrison?

1263
01:22:11,454 --> 01:22:13,615
- Are you okay?
- Excuse me. Excuse...

1264
01:22:13,789 --> 01:22:15,757
- You all right, sir?
- You okay?

1265
01:22:15,925 --> 01:22:19,292
Great. Well, my name is Julia,
and I'm gonna be your server tonight.

1266
01:22:19,462 --> 01:22:21,453
Why don't I get started
with a few specials?

1267
01:22:21,631 --> 01:22:22,962
Yes, please.

1268
01:22:23,132 --> 01:22:27,432
Tonight the chef is featuring a dish
that he likes to call the lying, stinking pig.

1269
01:22:28,137 --> 01:22:34,007
- You're kidding. How is that cooked?
- He starts by cutting off the pig's testicles...

1270
01:22:34,177 --> 01:22:37,738
...and he chops them up really finely,
teeny, tiny pieces.

1271
01:22:37,914 --> 01:22:41,941
And then he takes those testicles,
and he pulverizes them...

1272
01:22:42,118 --> 01:22:44,780
...and adds in a little arugula,
some sage...

1273
01:22:44,954 --> 01:22:47,752
...feta cheese, and shoves the mixture...

1274
01:22:47,924 --> 01:22:49,949
...back up the pig's...

1275
01:22:50,126 --> 01:22:52,287
Well, for lack of a better word, ass.

1276
01:22:54,297 --> 01:22:58,131
- Really?
- Yeah. Then he cuts out the heart...

1277
01:22:58,301 --> 01:23:00,826
...the cold, useless, tiny, little heart...

1278
01:23:01,003 --> 01:23:05,099
<i>...then fillets it on either side
and it's a nice amuse-bouche.</i>

1279
01:23:06,909 --> 01:23:09,742
- I'll have the salmon.
- Good choice.

1280
01:23:09,912 --> 01:23:11,607
For you, sir?

1281
01:23:11,781 --> 01:23:14,477
I'm not... I don't... I don't know.

1282
01:23:14,650 --> 01:23:18,416
Oh, just so you know,
the heart of the pig...

1283
01:23:18,588 --> 01:23:20,715
...little something like this.

1284
01:23:26,629 --> 01:23:27,653
Did we get a toy?

1285
01:23:28,364 --> 01:23:32,858
Maybe I'll give you a little time
to juggle the choices, sir.

1286
01:23:41,978 --> 01:23:43,673
Nicely done.

1287
01:23:43,846 --> 01:23:46,906
Miss Fitzpatrick, my son Franklin
really loves your class.

1288
01:23:47,083 --> 01:23:50,484
- Oh, he's got a great imagination.
- Yeah.

1289
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:52,412
So I guess we'll charge these to...

1290
01:23:52,588 --> 01:23:55,250
- Oh, charge these to my friend over there.
- I figured.

1291
01:23:55,424 --> 01:23:57,483
I put in some lobster tails
and a cheesecake.

1292
01:23:58,527 --> 01:24:00,358
Thank you, Amos.

1293
01:24:15,878 --> 01:24:17,846
And then maybe these?

1294
01:24:18,681 --> 01:24:21,548
Put that ticket right...
Put it where you're looking. Yep.

1295
01:24:21,717 --> 01:24:25,676
Yep. Great. Thank you.
Now let me take that thing.

1296
01:24:25,855 --> 01:24:28,415
Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

1297
01:24:30,359 --> 01:24:32,759
Oh, crap. Just go.

1298
01:24:32,928 --> 01:24:36,489
Golden Kadahi, best Indian restaurant
in Los Angeles. How may I help you?

1299
01:24:37,333 --> 01:24:40,825
Hi. This is Rehka speaking.

1300
01:24:47,076 --> 01:24:50,409
- Hey, Liz.
- Oh, hi.

1301
01:24:52,581 --> 01:24:53,707
- Hey.
- Hey.

1302
01:24:53,883 --> 01:24:56,374
I made it. Cannot even believe it.

1303
01:24:56,552 --> 01:24:58,247
- Oh, sorry.
- Sorry.

1304
01:24:58,421 --> 01:25:00,548
- Hi.
- Sorry.

1305
01:25:00,723 --> 01:25:02,816
Wow, Liz, you look beautiful.

1306
01:25:02,992 --> 01:25:06,723
Thank you. Paula's indefinite trip
out of the office coincided very nicely...

1307
01:25:06,896 --> 01:25:10,127
...with my "haul ass home
and throw on something festive" plan, so...

1308
01:25:10,299 --> 01:25:11,323
You look wonderful.

1309
01:25:14,804 --> 01:25:16,066
Hi.

1310
01:25:16,238 --> 01:25:17,262
- So...
- I was think...

1311
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:20,000
- What? Did you want...?
- Sorry. Go ahead. No, you first.

1312
01:25:20,176 --> 01:25:21,404
- Please. You should.
- You...

1313
01:25:21,577 --> 01:25:24,137
Oh, okay.
You don't wanna be an agent, do you?

1314
01:25:24,313 --> 01:25:26,281
No, but I may need an agent...

1315
01:25:26,449 --> 01:25:31,318
...so I figure might as well
learn the business while I'm agentless.

1316
01:25:31,487 --> 01:25:34,456
Good evening, sir, ma'am.
Welcome to The Blvd.

1317
01:25:34,623 --> 01:25:36,955
Would you like the four-course
Sweetheart's Menu...

1318
01:25:37,126 --> 01:25:40,789
...or the eight-course Eternal Love?
- Whoa, slow down.

1319
01:25:40,963 --> 01:25:43,955
Is there, like, a one-course
"Only Been Dating For Two Weeks...

1320
01:25:44,133 --> 01:25:46,601
...But It Looks Promising" option?

1321
01:25:47,336 --> 01:25:49,133
Because...

1322
01:25:49,305 --> 01:25:50,704
I'm kidding.

1323
01:25:50,873 --> 01:25:54,274
I realize that, sir.
I'll come back when you're serious.

1324
01:25:56,011 --> 01:25:58,411
He's your biggest fan.

1325
01:25:58,748 --> 01:26:00,545
Hello? That's my water.

1326
01:26:01,517 --> 01:26:04,714
You know, I didn't touch mine,
so why don't you go ahead and have it?

1327
01:26:04,887 --> 01:26:06,582
Happy Valentine's Day.

1328
01:26:06,756 --> 01:26:08,121
Well, same to you.

1329
01:26:08,290 --> 01:26:09,621
- Charlie!
- What?

1330
01:26:09,792 --> 01:26:11,692
She said happy Valentine's Day.

1331
01:26:11,861 --> 01:26:13,055
- Look...
- I can't talk now?

1332
01:26:13,229 --> 01:26:14,958
I'm sorry this place is such a zoo.

1333
01:26:15,131 --> 01:26:18,965
It's fine. I mean, they're fighting,
they're mating, and I'm in the zoo with you.

1334
01:26:23,139 --> 01:26:24,572
God.

1335
01:26:26,776 --> 01:26:30,371
Jason, um, I really like you...

1336
01:26:30,546 --> 01:26:33,743
...and I was... I just...

1337
01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:37,713
I'm just wondering how you feel...

1338
01:26:38,154 --> 01:26:39,815
...about the idea of...

1339
01:26:42,324 --> 01:26:44,849
Oh, God. I've gotta...
I'm gonna take this outside.

1340
01:26:45,027 --> 01:26:47,928
- Sure, sure, sure. Yeah, yeah. Go. Yeah.
- I'm sorry. Thank you.

1341
01:26:48,097 --> 01:26:49,223
Go ahead.

1342
01:26:49,398 --> 01:26:51,958
- Be right back.
- Sure.

1343
01:26:58,874 --> 01:27:01,001
All right, Stanley, listen to me.

1344
01:27:01,177 --> 01:27:03,941
We're gonna make this hard,
and we're gonna make this fast.

1345
01:27:04,113 --> 01:27:06,581
Yes, we can get you
two adjoining rooms.

1346
01:27:06,749 --> 01:27:09,513
Yes. But with the door open,
you still have to pay for both.

1347
01:27:09,685 --> 01:27:11,710
Okay. Bye-bye now. Hi.

1348
01:27:11,887 --> 01:27:13,912
Hi. Welcome to the Beverly Wilshire.

1349
01:27:14,089 --> 01:27:15,351
- How many checking in?
- Two.

1350
01:27:15,524 --> 01:27:16,548
- Two?
- I mean one.

1351
01:27:16,725 --> 01:27:20,058
Well, technically, it's two.
One person and Carmine, my dog.

1352
01:27:20,229 --> 01:27:22,754
A person and a dog.
Okay, that would be our pleasure.

1353
01:27:22,932 --> 01:27:23,956
Oh, okay.

1354
01:27:24,133 --> 01:27:26,294
Oh, and by the way,
happy Valentine's Day.

1355
01:27:27,336 --> 01:27:28,928
You too.

1356
01:27:30,539 --> 01:27:33,474
And Julia's not even in love
with that guy.

1357
01:27:34,076 --> 01:27:35,168
How do you know that?

1358
01:27:35,344 --> 01:27:39,747
She was too calm about the whole thing.
I mean, always under control.

1359
01:27:39,915 --> 01:27:41,177
Listen:

1360
01:27:41,350 --> 01:27:45,480
"The way of love is
not a subtle argument.

1361
01:27:45,654 --> 01:27:49,488
The door there is devastation."
The master.

1362
01:27:49,658 --> 01:27:52,593
So according to Rumi,
love has to be devastating?

1363
01:27:52,761 --> 01:27:57,255
Listen. You don't step into love, my friend,
you fall in. Head over heels.

1364
01:27:57,433 --> 01:28:01,893
You ever seen somebody fall
head over heels in love for real, Reed?

1365
01:28:02,071 --> 01:28:05,063
It's ugly, bro. Toxic, septic.

1366
01:28:05,241 --> 01:28:07,903
Come on, boss. Still got a few hours left.

1367
01:28:08,077 --> 01:28:11,274
Make something happen
with somebody someplace.

1368
01:28:11,447 --> 01:28:12,812
- Cookie?
- I'm good.

1369
01:28:12,982 --> 01:28:15,746
Day's not over yet, man. Give me some.

1370
01:28:16,352 --> 01:28:19,913
Hey, tell me something.
How'd you and your wife get it so right?

1371
01:28:20,856 --> 01:28:23,188
That's easy. I married my best friend.

1372
01:28:25,027 --> 01:28:26,517
Thought I was your best friend.

1373
01:28:26,695 --> 01:28:29,789
Yeah, you're my man. That's my lady.

1374
01:28:30,499 --> 01:28:32,990
- Night.
- Good night.

1375
01:28:33,469 --> 01:28:36,131
- Go give your wife those cookies, huh?
- Best for the best.

1376
01:28:36,305 --> 01:28:39,866
Yeah. Best for the best.

1377
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:07,469
- Kate. Hey, have a great trip.
- Thanks. Nice meeting you.

1378
01:29:07,636 --> 01:29:09,297
Yeah.

1379
01:29:09,471 --> 01:29:11,666
- This is my taxi!
- No, no, I been waiting.

1380
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:14,502
- I been waiting 45 minutes.
- Be a little patient, folks.

1381
01:29:18,581 --> 01:29:20,572
- Hey, Redmond.
- Welcome back, Mr. Wilson.

1382
01:29:20,749 --> 01:29:22,876
- Did you have to wait long?
- Not long at all.

1383
01:29:23,052 --> 01:29:25,111
- Check any bags?
- No.

1384
01:29:28,857 --> 01:29:30,950
They're right through there.

1385
01:29:39,735 --> 01:29:40,997
May I help you, captain?

1386
01:29:42,071 --> 01:29:43,538
Thank you.

1387
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:45,664
You okay?

1388
01:29:45,841 --> 01:29:49,937
No, I'm fine. It's just the SuperShuttle, it's
gonna take nine stops to get to my house.

1389
01:29:50,112 --> 01:29:53,604
Thought I'd pay for a cab, and I go
there, and the line's two miles long.

1390
01:29:53,782 --> 01:29:57,548
- Now I'm headed to the rental car place.
- Which is gonna take an hour.

1391
01:29:57,720 --> 01:29:58,812
- I'm gonna help.
- Really?

1392
01:29:58,988 --> 01:30:00,615
Yeah, I have a car.

1393
01:30:00,889 --> 01:30:02,049
I live in the Valley.

1394
01:30:02,224 --> 01:30:04,920
I want you to have it.
You traveled so far for a few hours.

1395
01:30:05,094 --> 01:30:07,585
You should spend every possible second
with this guy.

1396
01:30:07,763 --> 01:30:08,957
And it's already paid for.

1397
01:30:09,131 --> 01:30:11,497
Redmond will take you
wherever you need to go.

1398
01:30:11,667 --> 01:30:13,567
You just give him the address.

1399
01:30:16,305 --> 01:30:18,535
Thank you. Thank you.

1400
01:30:21,543 --> 01:30:23,374
He's a lucky man.

1401
01:30:28,083 --> 01:30:29,744
- Thank you.
- Bye.

1402
01:30:33,689 --> 01:30:36,419
Rani, sweetheart, why are you moping?

1403
01:30:36,592 --> 01:30:39,652
Is this about a boy
because it's Valentine's Day?

1404
01:30:39,828 --> 01:30:43,286
Did you get many valentines?
Oh, sweetheart, don't be sad.

1405
01:30:43,465 --> 01:30:45,524
When the time is right, your father and I...

1406
01:30:45,701 --> 01:30:47,999
...we are going to find you
a nice Indian boy.

1407
01:30:48,871 --> 01:30:51,965
Hey, cheer up, Rani.
I'll be your valentine.

1408
01:30:52,141 --> 01:30:54,132
Alex, please, for now,
be our delivery boy.

1409
01:30:54,309 --> 01:30:58,370
I have an Indian wedding,
and I have a private party going on.

1410
01:31:00,449 --> 01:31:01,780
Perfect.

1411
01:31:01,950 --> 01:31:03,611
Beverly Wilshire, this is Michelle.

1412
01:31:03,786 --> 01:31:07,085
Yeah, I'm gonna have to put you on hold.
All right, thanks. Bye-bye.

1413
01:31:07,256 --> 01:31:08,280
Excuse me.

1414
01:31:08,457 --> 01:31:12,018
You didn't happen to see a really pretty girl,
blue dress, come through here?

1415
01:31:12,194 --> 01:31:16,927
- Are you a guest of the hotel, or...?
- No, we were at the early seating.

1416
01:31:17,099 --> 01:31:20,091
Okay. Yeah, she was on the phone,
and she just went out that way.

1417
01:31:20,269 --> 01:31:22,499
- Oh, okay. Thanks.
- Yeah, no problem.

1418
01:31:23,372 --> 01:31:26,364
Put the blindfold on right now, Stanley.

1419
01:31:26,542 --> 01:31:28,772
Oh, you know what's gonna happen
when you do.

1420
01:31:28,944 --> 01:31:31,037
Sugar and your little kitty cat...

1421
01:31:31,647 --> 01:31:36,141
...oh, we're gonna lick you
all up and down.

1422
01:31:36,318 --> 01:31:41,051
Scratchy little tongues
going up and down your...

1423
01:31:41,223 --> 01:31:44,124
Oh! Rrrrr. Mm.

1424
01:31:44,293 --> 01:31:48,957
Oh, Stanley, I'm gonna have to have
a mint julep to cool down after that one.

1425
01:31:49,131 --> 01:31:52,362
Talk to you next time. Thank you.

1426
01:31:52,768 --> 01:31:53,792
Oh, God.

1427
01:31:53,969 --> 01:31:57,097
That is a really unusual way
to talk to your boss.

1428
01:31:57,272 --> 01:32:00,708
- It's not what you think.
- Really? Oh, awesome.

1429
01:32:00,876 --> 01:32:05,745
Because what I think it is is you leaving me
to talk dirty to your boyfriend, Stanley. So...

1430
01:32:05,914 --> 01:32:07,711
- No, no, no.
- What a relief to know...

1431
01:32:07,883 --> 01:32:11,375
...you're not someone who licks people
with their scratchy kitty-cat tongue.

1432
01:32:11,553 --> 01:32:14,522
I moonlight
as an adult-phone entertainer.

1433
01:32:15,758 --> 01:32:18,886
- Like phone sex?
- Yes.

1434
01:32:21,163 --> 01:32:24,030
This is the busiest day of the year
for phone sex.

1435
01:32:24,199 --> 01:32:25,325
Surprise.

1436
01:32:29,671 --> 01:32:31,195
Why didn't you tell me?

1437
01:32:32,474 --> 01:32:33,873
Okay.

1438
01:32:34,042 --> 01:32:38,706
I'm broke. I have a hundred-K student loan
I have no idea how I'm going to pay off.

1439
01:32:38,881 --> 01:32:40,143
I have no health insurance.

1440
01:32:40,315 --> 01:32:42,840
So if you know of a job
that will pay a poetry major...

1441
01:32:43,018 --> 01:32:47,114
...more than $40 an hour,
with her clothes on, I'm all ears.

1442
01:32:47,289 --> 01:32:48,654
Okay.

1443
01:32:49,258 --> 01:32:52,284
- I'm out.
- Are you gonna call me?

1444
01:32:52,461 --> 01:32:55,259
Well, you know,
I'd like to say yes, but...

1445
01:32:55,764 --> 01:32:57,925
...I don't know if I can afford it.

1446
01:32:58,400 --> 01:32:59,867
I'm sorry, that was... I'm sorry.

1447
01:33:01,370 --> 01:33:04,806
Come on, you know I didn't mean that.
I'm just... This is, like...

1448
01:33:04,973 --> 01:33:06,634
This is way too much for me, okay?

1449
01:33:07,442 --> 01:33:08,773
I'm from Muncie, Indiana.

1450
01:33:08,944 --> 01:33:11,378
Like, the wildest thing I ever did was...

1451
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:14,542
...leave Muncie, Indiana.

1452
01:33:14,917 --> 01:33:17,442
- Look, this is me, it's not you.
- Yeah.

1453
01:33:18,053 --> 01:33:19,077
I just...

1454
01:33:20,889 --> 01:33:22,447
I'm sorry, Liz.

1455
01:33:28,330 --> 01:33:33,927
Welcome to the Hollywood Forever
Cemetery. Enjoy your romantic evening.

1456
01:33:34,102 --> 01:33:37,560
Please, everyone form a single-file line.

1457
01:33:41,176 --> 01:33:44,111
She said she would meet me right before
showtime. Here it is...

1458
01:33:44,279 --> 01:33:45,746
...but she's not here yet, and...

1459
01:33:45,914 --> 01:33:47,973
I got her these flowers
because I'm so sorry.

1460
01:33:48,150 --> 01:33:51,779
I mean, it was a small fire.
It's a small dog. Everything's fine, and...

1461
01:33:52,521 --> 01:33:54,648
We're sold out.

1462
01:33:54,823 --> 01:33:58,759
Oh, I'm sorry, sir, but we are completely
sold out. Only pre-sold tickets.

1463
01:33:58,927 --> 01:34:01,259
No, you don't understand.
I need a ticket tonight.

1464
01:34:01,430 --> 01:34:03,864
But I mean, I packed a basket.
It's got her favorite.

1465
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:05,795
- Ham hocks and squid and...
- Actually...

1466
01:34:05,968 --> 01:34:08,163
...you know what, sir?

1467
01:34:08,337 --> 01:34:10,032
I have an extra ticket.

1468
01:34:10,205 --> 01:34:12,673
- Oh, that's your ticket?
- That's my ticket.

1469
01:34:12,841 --> 01:34:17,210
It's your lucky night. Have a great time.
All right, everyone, we are sold out.

1470
01:34:17,379 --> 01:34:20,348
- So who do I thank?
- Jason, from Indiana.

1471
01:34:20,515 --> 01:34:22,176
Edgar, from New York.

1472
01:34:22,351 --> 01:34:25,787
Yeah, my wife and I used to come here
every Valentine's Day, but...

1473
01:34:25,954 --> 01:34:28,081
Well, except tonight.

1474
01:34:28,257 --> 01:34:31,522
Well, you know,
I had the extra ticket, so...

1475
01:34:31,693 --> 01:34:34,491
On Valentine's Day.
Well, there's gotta be a story there.

1476
01:34:34,663 --> 01:34:37,223
Well, yeah, not a good one.

1477
01:34:37,399 --> 01:34:40,698
Pretty much the worst
Valentine's Day story of all time.

1478
01:34:40,869 --> 01:34:42,564
You wanna bet?

1479
01:34:42,738 --> 01:34:43,762
Thank you, officers.

1480
01:34:43,939 --> 01:34:46,203
- Thank you, Nikki. They're beautiful.
- Thank you.

1481
01:34:46,375 --> 01:34:48,070
Siena Bouquet.

1482
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:52,177
Yeah, we're still open
for about another hour.

1483
01:34:52,347 --> 01:34:53,939
Mister?

1484
01:34:54,750 --> 01:35:00,279
You owe me flowers.

1485
01:35:05,928 --> 01:35:06,952
Where we taking them?

1486
01:35:16,705 --> 01:35:20,266
Okay,
I'm gonna go now. Have a nice life.

1487
01:35:27,349 --> 01:35:28,839
You came.

1488
01:35:31,620 --> 01:35:33,019
What happened?

1489
01:35:46,601 --> 01:35:48,193
He's married.

1490
01:36:18,367 --> 01:36:20,927
Now that's open-heart surgery.

1491
01:36:22,738 --> 01:36:24,296
- Peppermint Pattie?
- Yep.

1492
01:36:27,509 --> 01:36:30,876
Don't step on the people,
step on the grass.

1493
01:36:31,046 --> 01:36:32,775
Step on the grass.

1494
01:36:32,948 --> 01:36:35,075
This telephone girl, you like her, huh?

1495
01:36:37,085 --> 01:36:40,452
Thought maybe she had the trifecta.

1496
01:36:40,922 --> 01:36:43,015
Trifecta? What's that?

1497
01:36:43,191 --> 01:36:45,386
Oh, you know,
it's like the big three S's.

1498
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:49,189
Smart, sensitive, sexy.

1499
01:36:49,865 --> 01:36:51,127
That's my trifecta.

1500
01:36:53,268 --> 01:36:54,496
- Her?
- Mm-hm.

1501
01:36:54,669 --> 01:36:56,330
You mean, like, literally, that...?

1502
01:36:56,505 --> 01:36:59,941
- Literally. Her.
- She was hot.

1503
01:37:00,675 --> 01:37:02,165
Still is.

1504
01:37:08,850 --> 01:37:09,942
Hey, hey.

1505
01:37:10,118 --> 01:37:11,449
- You guys came!
- You're here!

1506
01:37:11,620 --> 01:37:14,054
I thought you were going out
with your new boyfriend.

1507
01:37:14,222 --> 01:37:16,486
I thought you had a date
with your old boyfriend.

1508
01:37:16,658 --> 01:37:17,716
Same guy.

1509
01:37:17,893 --> 01:37:18,917
- No.
- Not surprised.

1510
01:37:19,094 --> 01:37:22,359
Booked back-to-back at the same
restaurant. Thought we wouldn't notice.

1511
01:37:22,531 --> 01:37:24,294
- What?
- Please lead me to the alcohol.

1512
01:37:24,466 --> 01:37:27,458
- Right here. Sit down.
- We are gonna take good care of you.

1513
01:37:27,636 --> 01:37:29,160
What happened to the piñata?

1514
01:37:29,337 --> 01:37:33,535
- Oh, it got what it deserved.
- Oh, more sad and Ionely people.

1515
01:37:33,708 --> 01:37:35,369
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Elise.

1516
01:37:35,944 --> 01:37:39,539
I'm driving around, looking in all
the places he's probably gonna be, but...

1517
01:37:39,714 --> 01:37:41,579
Anyways, like I said, just call me back.

1518
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:45,811
But no big deal, I've got it under control,
so I'll find him.

1519
01:37:46,555 --> 01:37:49,319
I've found him! Found him.

1520
01:37:49,491 --> 01:37:52,654
Oh, my God, he's in a van. Shit!
What are you doing in a van?

1521
01:37:52,828 --> 01:37:54,420
Edison!

1522
01:37:55,764 --> 01:37:57,755
Burn, baby, burn!

1523
01:37:57,933 --> 01:37:58,957
Justin Levy.

1524
01:37:59,134 --> 01:38:01,398
Broke up with me
on the morning of my birthday...

1525
01:38:01,570 --> 01:38:04,368
...still showed up to my party.

1526
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:06,535
Burn, baby, burn!

1527
01:38:07,309 --> 01:38:09,072
Ivonne Quinteros.

1528
01:38:09,244 --> 01:38:12,805
Dumped me for the piano player
at the Beverly Wilshire.

1529
01:38:12,981 --> 01:38:15,415
- Two hours ago.
- Oh, Charlie.

1530
01:38:15,584 --> 01:38:20,248
- Burn, baby, burn!
- Fire marshal know about this burning pot?

1531
01:38:20,422 --> 01:38:22,686
- Oh, hey, Kelvin.
- Hey.

1532
01:38:22,858 --> 01:38:23,950
Back to the wine.

1533
01:38:24,126 --> 01:38:26,617
- What are you doing here?
- I had a little time...

1534
01:38:26,795 --> 01:38:30,458
...before my 10:00 broadcast, somebody
said there was a gathering of my people.

1535
01:38:30,632 --> 01:38:33,066
- How did you find us?
- Heather.

1536
01:38:33,235 --> 01:38:36,932
Right, right. Well, welcome.

1537
01:38:37,105 --> 01:38:39,869
- Hi. I'm Julia.
- I'm Kelvin.

1538
01:38:40,041 --> 01:38:43,670
- Hi. So you guys know each other?
- Yes.

1539
01:38:43,845 --> 01:38:46,143
What misadventure of the heart
brings you here?

1540
01:38:46,314 --> 01:38:48,646
Oh, actually, I'm Kara's date.

1541
01:38:50,018 --> 01:38:53,317
- Fascinating.
- Yeah.

1542
01:38:53,488 --> 01:38:55,820
Whoo.

1543
01:39:03,498 --> 01:39:05,989
- Edison!
- All right, buddy.

1544
01:39:06,168 --> 01:39:09,001
- Don't move!
- I'm really, really sorry.

1545
01:39:09,171 --> 01:39:11,901
Okay, but you can't do that to me.
Do you understand?

1546
01:39:12,073 --> 01:39:14,769
I know, I know.
But this was really important.

1547
01:39:14,943 --> 01:39:17,741
- She had to get her flowers.
- Is everything okay?

1548
01:39:17,913 --> 01:39:20,609
- Yeah, I'm his babysitter.
- I'm his florist.

1549
01:39:22,384 --> 01:39:25,444
Look, I'm glad you're okay.

1550
01:39:25,620 --> 01:39:27,588
Do you want me to come in there
with you?

1551
01:39:27,756 --> 01:39:31,248
No. I think this is one of those things
I have to do myself.

1552
01:39:33,094 --> 01:39:35,187
I've been driving Holden for a long time.

1553
01:39:35,363 --> 01:39:37,957
He's never given his car up for anybody.

1554
01:39:38,133 --> 01:39:40,158
You must be pretty special.

1555
01:39:41,636 --> 01:39:45,470
<i>Over?
Why do you keep talking like it's over?</i>

1556
01:39:46,041 --> 01:39:48,032
<i>I love you.</i>

1557
01:39:50,045 --> 01:39:51,672
Edgar!

1558
01:39:53,615 --> 01:39:56,641
<i>- Hey, get out of the way!
- I'll always love you.</i>

1559
01:39:56,818 --> 01:39:58,843
- Edgar!
- Excuse me.

1560
01:39:59,020 --> 01:40:00,612
Down in front!

1561
01:40:00,789 --> 01:40:02,757
Edgar, where are you?
I know you're out there.

1562
01:40:02,924 --> 01:40:04,118
Shh!

1563
01:40:04,292 --> 01:40:07,022
- Who the hell is Edgar?
- He is my husband, and shut your mouth.

1564
01:40:07,195 --> 01:40:10,392
- Edgar, answer me.
- Answer her, Edgar.

1565
01:40:10,565 --> 01:40:13,932
- Lady, I can't see through you.
- Edgar, where are you?

1566
01:40:14,502 --> 01:40:16,970
- Estelle!
- Edgar, answer me.

1567
01:40:17,138 --> 01:40:19,629
- Estelle!
- That must be Edgar.

1568
01:40:20,275 --> 01:40:22,573
I'm here! I'm coming.

1569
01:40:23,945 --> 01:40:25,469
Sorry.

1570
01:40:25,647 --> 01:40:28,514
- I see.
- Hey, run lower!

1571
01:40:31,820 --> 01:40:34,186
Listen to me. I know I let you down.

1572
01:40:34,356 --> 01:40:36,449
Maybe you don't think
I deserve forgiveness...

1573
01:40:36,625 --> 01:40:40,322
...but you're gonna give it to me anyway,
because when you love someone...

1574
01:40:40,495 --> 01:40:44,226
...you love all of them. That's the job.
- I know that now.

1575
01:40:44,399 --> 01:40:45,991
I'm so sorry.

1576
01:40:46,167 --> 01:40:48,795
And now, please, you gotta love
everything about them.

1577
01:40:48,970 --> 01:40:51,234
Not just the good things,
but the bad things too.

1578
01:40:51,406 --> 01:40:54,671
The things that you find lovable,
and the things that you don't find lovable.

1579
01:40:54,843 --> 01:40:57,175
Shh. I understand.

1580
01:40:57,345 --> 01:40:59,643
I'll never leave you.

1581
01:41:23,905 --> 01:41:26,237
<i>At first I was afraid, I was petrified</i>

1582
01:41:26,408 --> 01:41:29,935
<i>Kept thinking I could never live
Without you by my side</i>

1583
01:41:30,111 --> 01:41:33,842
<i>Then I spent so many nights
Thinking how you did me wrong</i>

1584
01:41:34,015 --> 01:41:37,576
<i>And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along</i>

1585
01:41:37,752 --> 01:41:40,016
<i>And so you're back from outer space</i>

1586
01:41:40,188 --> 01:41:43,589
Julia, I found this little friend of Rani's,
and I think he's looking for you.

1587
01:41:43,758 --> 01:41:44,782
I'm not little.

1588
01:41:44,959 --> 01:41:48,417
Edison, are you okay?
Does somebody know that you're here?

1589
01:41:48,596 --> 01:41:50,587
Yeah, my babysitter's outside.

1590
01:41:50,765 --> 01:41:51,993
Okay.

1591
01:41:52,167 --> 01:41:53,998
<i>- Oh, now go
- Go</i>

1592
01:41:54,169 --> 01:41:56,000
<i>- Walk out the door
- Out that door</i>

1593
01:41:56,171 --> 01:41:58,230
<i>Just turn around now</i>

1594
01:41:59,074 --> 01:42:00,939
This is for you.

1595
01:42:02,510 --> 01:42:05,445
- For me?
- You're my valentine.

1596
01:42:11,453 --> 01:42:12,943
Thank you.

1597
01:42:14,923 --> 01:42:17,323
Oh, this is beautiful.

1598
01:42:17,492 --> 01:42:18,686
Wha...?

1599
01:42:19,361 --> 01:42:22,853
Are you sure that I am really the person
that you wanna give this to?

1600
01:42:23,031 --> 01:42:26,432
Yeah. I mean, I think so.

1601
01:42:26,601 --> 01:42:27,625
Why?

1602
01:42:27,802 --> 01:42:32,466
Well, when you pick a valentine you have to
be sure that you choose the right person.

1603
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:36,440
Or else you could be overlooking someone
who's even more special to you.

1604
01:42:39,214 --> 01:42:42,775
Rani? But I don't love her. I love you.

1605
01:42:42,951 --> 01:42:46,011
Is it our age difference
that keeps you from going:

1606
01:42:46,187 --> 01:42:48,052
Boom, boom, boom.

1607
01:42:48,223 --> 01:42:49,451
Yeah, a little bit.

1608
01:42:49,624 --> 01:42:53,151
Is it my height? Because I'm gonna grow.

1609
01:42:53,328 --> 01:42:55,057
Well, then, no, it's not your height.

1610
01:42:55,230 --> 01:42:58,825
It's just it wouldn't be right,
because I know Rani likes you.

1611
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:02,231
Really?
Well, I like her a lot too.

1612
01:43:02,404 --> 01:43:05,703
She's the only other fifth-grader
who has Frank Zappa on her iPod.

1613
01:43:05,874 --> 01:43:08,104
- See?
- And she loves giraffes.

1614
01:43:08,276 --> 01:43:10,744
See, giraffes, it's something you guys
have in common.

1615
01:43:10,912 --> 01:43:13,312
See, it's things like that
that can turn a friend...

1616
01:43:13,481 --> 01:43:16,712
...from someone that you like
into someone that you love.

1617
01:43:17,619 --> 01:43:19,814
Has that ever happened to you,
Miss Fitzpatrick?

1618
01:43:26,027 --> 01:43:27,255
Hello?

1619
01:43:29,697 --> 01:43:33,133
<i>Hey, hey</i>

1620
01:43:36,871 --> 01:43:39,465
Back to the chocolate!

1621
01:43:40,208 --> 01:43:41,368
I am the chocolate.

1622
01:43:41,543 --> 01:43:44,512
Oh, you are.
Thank you so much for coming.

1623
01:43:44,679 --> 01:43:48,308
You are the most special valentine
I have ever had.

1624
01:43:52,020 --> 01:43:55,217
- But it was great. And bye.
- Bye.

1625
01:43:57,025 --> 01:43:59,493
- Don't know how to do that.
- I'll teach you.

1626
01:43:59,661 --> 01:44:02,061
- There you go. Right on... There it is. Close.
- Okay.

1627
01:44:02,230 --> 01:44:04,061
I know, you gotta go to work.

1628
01:44:04,232 --> 01:44:05,859
Bolly, bolly!

1629
01:44:12,207 --> 01:44:14,698
Here. Happy Valentine's Day.

1630
01:44:16,811 --> 01:44:21,077
I don't usually go for girls my own age,
but you're pretty cool.

1631
01:44:21,816 --> 01:44:23,977
Wow, thanks.

1632
01:44:28,690 --> 01:44:31,158
I don't really have anything else to say.

1633
01:44:31,826 --> 01:44:35,956
<i>Now I'm wondering
If your love's still strong</i>

1634
01:44:36,130 --> 01:44:39,759
<i>Here I am
Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours</i>

1635
01:44:46,508 --> 01:44:47,736
I saw Edison.

1636
01:44:47,909 --> 01:44:49,968
I tipped the valet
to keep an eye on him.

1637
01:44:50,144 --> 01:44:52,544
I have the delivery van
set up over there.

1638
01:44:52,714 --> 01:44:56,013
We could take a trip to Mulholland.
Come check it out.

1639
01:44:56,184 --> 01:45:01,315
- Alex, can I be honest with you?
- I love it when you're honest.

1640
01:45:01,656 --> 01:45:04,022
I don't know if I'm ready for this.

1641
01:45:04,959 --> 01:45:08,087
- Lie to me.
- No, look, I'm serious.

1642
01:45:11,366 --> 01:45:13,960
<i>Signed, sealed, delivered</i>

1643
01:45:14,135 --> 01:45:15,898
I'm gonna go now.

1644
01:45:18,640 --> 01:45:21,404
<i>Signed, sealed, delivered</i>

1645
01:45:21,576 --> 01:45:22,975
Bye.

1646
01:45:26,714 --> 01:45:30,707
I guess that I thought that if we did this,
we'd have this special bond...

1647
01:45:30,885 --> 01:45:34,582
...and now I'm realizing that something
like this you can't just plan, you know?

1648
01:45:34,756 --> 01:45:36,553
It has to happen.

1649
01:45:37,258 --> 01:45:39,556
I mean, we have a chance
to make it happen.

1650
01:45:39,727 --> 01:45:43,663
But did you hear what you said,
"make it happen"?

1651
01:45:43,831 --> 01:45:47,323
We shouldn't have to make it happen.

1652
01:45:48,102 --> 01:45:50,263
Look, sit.

1653
01:45:50,705 --> 01:45:54,539
This is so sweet, and...

1654
01:45:54,709 --> 01:45:57,803
Look, Alex, I love you. I just...

1655
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:00,875
I really think we should wait.

1656
01:46:01,349 --> 01:46:02,475
I'm sorry.

1657
01:46:04,719 --> 01:46:08,018
It's okay. I love you too.

1658
01:46:09,023 --> 01:46:10,456
And...

1659
01:46:12,026 --> 01:46:14,017
...we can still make out.

1660
01:46:29,644 --> 01:46:30,770
Bye.

1661
01:47:30,938 --> 01:47:35,307
Paula Thomas. Whoever this is better have
a good reason for calling me this late.

1662
01:47:37,211 --> 01:47:39,076
You want me to do what?

1663
01:47:39,881 --> 01:47:42,406
Boy, do you know who you're talking to?

1664
01:47:44,652 --> 01:47:46,517
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

1665
01:47:46,688 --> 01:47:48,952
Vladimir.

1666
01:47:52,860 --> 01:47:55,090
Well, let me tell you something, Vladimir.

1667
01:47:55,263 --> 01:48:00,291
You don't know what rough is
until you've dealt with a true African queen.

1668
01:48:00,468 --> 01:48:02,800
Let me get my stick.

1669
01:48:04,005 --> 01:48:05,700
Kneel to Nzinga!

1670
01:48:13,648 --> 01:48:16,344
Attention, I'm going home now.

1671
01:48:16,517 --> 01:48:19,577
But I wanted to say goodnight
to the world's greatest boss...

1672
01:48:19,754 --> 01:48:22,882
...and tell him that we all love him.

1673
01:48:27,361 --> 01:48:29,124
Good night, Nikki.

1674
01:49:40,635 --> 01:49:42,034
You saw.

1675
01:49:42,804 --> 01:49:44,237
Yeah.

1676
01:49:47,542 --> 01:49:50,443
I'd like to take to comment
on the story that we broke earlier.

1677
01:49:50,611 --> 01:49:52,579
Quarterback sensation Sean Jackson...

1678
01:49:52,747 --> 01:49:55,511
...has popped the lock on the closet
and come out.

1679
01:49:55,683 --> 01:49:59,619
What does this mean? Will there be more
house music played in the locker room?

1680
01:49:59,787 --> 01:50:03,052
These questions aside, Mr. Jackson's
name is likely to be remembered...

1681
01:50:03,224 --> 01:50:06,489
...alongside Jackie Robinson,
Muhammad Ali, and Billie Jean King...

1682
01:50:06,661 --> 01:50:09,095
...who endured their share
of trash-talking as well.

1683
01:50:09,263 --> 01:50:13,199
But let's allow future generations to decide
where to place Sean Jackson in history.

1684
01:50:13,367 --> 01:50:15,927
It's not about defiance...

1685
01:50:16,103 --> 01:50:19,095
...it's about what a man will do for love.

1686
01:50:19,273 --> 01:50:22,436
I stand behind you, Sean. Metaphorically.

1687
01:50:22,610 --> 01:50:23,668
- Oh, jeez.
- Thank you.

1688
01:50:23,845 --> 01:50:24,971
Good night.

1689
01:50:25,680 --> 01:50:27,875
And that's it for tonight's news.

1690
01:50:28,049 --> 01:50:34,147
Happy Valentine's Day to all of you.
Sherry Donaldson for KVLA, channel 13.

1691
01:50:34,322 --> 01:50:35,619
- Good. Hey, man.
- Excellent.

1692
01:50:35,790 --> 01:50:38,281
- Hey, way to go, bro.
- Cue music, cue logo.

1693
01:50:38,459 --> 01:50:39,926
You sneaky little cupid.

1694
01:50:40,094 --> 01:50:42,562
You got romantic after all, didn't you?

1695
01:50:42,730 --> 01:50:45,324
I may get a few letters on that,
but I got your back.

1696
01:50:45,499 --> 01:50:47,694
- Thank you.
- Happy Valentine's Day, Kelvin.

1697
01:50:47,869 --> 01:50:49,063
Same to you.

1698
01:50:49,237 --> 01:50:52,536
Well, those stairs never looked so good.

1699
01:50:53,741 --> 01:50:57,108
Interesting perspective on Sean Jackson.

1700
01:51:12,360 --> 01:51:14,225
Just a second.

1701
01:51:20,067 --> 01:51:21,694
Who is it?

1702
01:51:24,238 --> 01:51:25,466
You forgot your camera.

1703
01:51:29,343 --> 01:51:30,401
Can I come in?

1704
01:51:34,582 --> 01:51:36,174
Sure.

1705
01:51:39,654 --> 01:51:42,646
Jason, I feel bad about
how you found out about my job.

1706
01:51:42,823 --> 01:51:44,723
It was awkward, and I'm sorry.

1707
01:51:44,892 --> 01:51:47,087
But that is the only thing
that I apologize for.

1708
01:51:47,261 --> 01:51:50,662
No. I should be the one apologizing.

1709
01:51:51,432 --> 01:51:57,064
If you want to be
a adult phone entertainer...

1710
01:51:57,371 --> 01:51:58,497
...that's cool.

1711
01:51:59,507 --> 01:52:00,872
I don't know, Jason.

1712
01:52:01,042 --> 01:52:04,739
When you found out something about me
you didn't like, you judged me and bailed.

1713
01:52:04,912 --> 01:52:07,813
I don't think that's a promising
foundation for a relationship.

1714
01:52:07,982 --> 01:52:11,679
You know what? You're right.
I just spent all night in a cemetery.

1715
01:52:11,852 --> 01:52:14,377
And I actually learned something.

1716
01:52:15,056 --> 01:52:16,250
In a relationship...

1717
01:52:16,424 --> 01:52:18,722
...you have to accept the other person...

1718
01:52:18,893 --> 01:52:22,420
...for all of what they are,
not just the parts that are easy to like.

1719
01:52:22,596 --> 01:52:28,034
And you're stupid if you turn your back
on something as important...

1720
01:52:29,036 --> 01:52:30,060
...as...

1721
01:52:32,807 --> 01:52:34,069
...Iove.

1722
01:52:37,712 --> 01:52:41,705
So I bought this for you. At the store.

1723
01:52:51,325 --> 01:52:53,316
And this one goes...

1724
01:53:11,278 --> 01:53:14,372
Sugar can't answer the phone right now.

1725
01:53:15,583 --> 01:53:19,178
She's got to make love
to her boyfriend on Valentine's Day.

1726
01:53:24,425 --> 01:53:27,553
And, for the record, this is what I like.

1727
01:53:27,728 --> 01:53:29,593
Simple.

1728
01:53:41,242 --> 01:53:42,504
Yeah.

1729
01:53:43,177 --> 01:53:45,645
Let's just keep it really simple.

1730
01:53:45,813 --> 01:53:49,180
- I also like make-up sex.
- Whoa, what a coincidence.

1731
01:53:49,350 --> 01:53:50,544
- You too?
- Me too.

1732
01:53:50,718 --> 01:53:52,208
Yay!

1733
01:54:18,646 --> 01:54:19,943
Hi.

1734
01:54:23,751 --> 01:54:25,912
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

1735
01:54:27,855 --> 01:54:30,085
What are you doing with the flowers?

1736
01:54:30,624 --> 01:54:32,819
They're all the ones that nobody wants.

1737
01:54:32,993 --> 01:54:35,154
So you're giving them a second life?

1738
01:54:36,197 --> 01:54:38,722
Yeah, most shops throw them away.

1739
01:54:41,035 --> 01:54:45,802
I like the idea that tomorrow, somebody's
gonna see them floating by and...

1740
01:54:45,973 --> 01:54:47,201
Yeah.

1741
01:54:47,374 --> 01:54:50,104
- Wonder where they come from.
And the mystery of it all.

1742
01:54:50,277 --> 01:54:52,939
I used to actually put them together...

1743
01:54:53,914 --> 01:54:56,644
...and practice new designs with them...

1744
01:54:56,817 --> 01:55:00,275
...and drop them off at a random doorstep
with a note saying:

1745
01:55:00,454 --> 01:55:03,116
"Somebody out there loves you."

1746
01:55:03,457 --> 01:55:05,482
Then I got to thinking...

1747
01:55:06,827 --> 01:55:09,523
...what if they found out
that someone was me?

1748
01:55:10,097 --> 01:55:12,361
Would they want me to be the one that
loves them?

1749
01:55:14,401 --> 01:55:15,595
I would...

1750
01:55:18,172 --> 01:55:19,799
...want that.

1751
01:55:25,679 --> 01:55:27,340
Am I about to kiss my best friend?

1752
01:55:29,316 --> 01:55:31,011
I hope so.

1753
01:55:41,162 --> 01:55:44,325
- Not great.
- That was awkward. Awkward.

1754
01:55:44,498 --> 01:55:46,591
- Just not great.
- Yep.

1755
01:55:46,767 --> 01:55:49,531
- But this is my old... Where I get down.
- This is your spot.

1756
01:55:49,703 --> 01:55:51,466
You really helped me out. Susan is...

1757
01:55:51,639 --> 01:55:54,574
- Giving me a chance to be number one.
- Congratulations.

1758
01:55:54,742 --> 01:55:56,209
- Thank you, again.
- Thank you.

1759
01:55:56,377 --> 01:55:58,277
- I'm gonna have to teach you.
- That is...

1760
01:55:58,612 --> 01:56:00,671
- No... I'll teach you this.
- It's not natural.

1761
01:56:00,848 --> 01:56:03,214
<i>- Keep the fist... It's a little...
- Thank you. Okay.</i>

1762
01:56:03,384 --> 01:56:05,011
<i>- No, no, no. Open your...
- Open.</i>

1763
01:56:05,186 --> 01:56:07,654
<i>- You know what? I got a better idea.
- Not happening.</i>

1764
01:56:15,696 --> 01:56:17,129
<i>Okay.</i>

1765
01:56:17,731 --> 01:56:19,722
<i>That was nice.</i>

1766
01:56:23,103 --> 01:56:26,539
Well, you didn't exactly, like,
knock it out of the park.

1767
01:56:26,707 --> 01:56:30,609
Well, we've never practiced,
you have to admit.

1768
01:56:30,778 --> 01:56:33,838
- Maybe we should practice, then.
- Okay.

1769
01:56:52,199 --> 01:56:53,632
Mommy!

1770
01:56:58,639 --> 01:57:00,504
You're so big.

1771
01:57:04,278 --> 01:57:06,109
You're so big.

1772
01:57:21,695 --> 01:57:23,720
- Did you imagine it better or worse?
- I did.

1773
01:57:23,897 --> 01:57:26,161
- You imagined it better?
- I gave you more credit.

1774
01:57:26,333 --> 01:57:27,357
- Really?
- Yeah.

1775
01:57:27,534 --> 01:57:31,664
- Well, I hate that I'm not living up to my...
- Well, I don't know.

1776
01:57:45,753 --> 01:57:49,086
<i>It's Romeo Midnight, one last time.</i>

1777
01:57:49,256 --> 01:57:53,056
<i>Only 30 seconds left now
before it's just another day.</i>

1778
01:57:53,227 --> 01:57:54,751
<i>So count it down with me, lovers.</i>

1779
01:57:54,928 --> 01:57:59,729
<i>And raise your glass to those three
little words that we all want to hear:</i>

1780
01:57:59,900 --> 01:58:03,802
<i>"Let's get naked."</i>

1781
01:58:15,549 --> 01:58:18,541
I never had a inkling before, man.
I didn't know what to do.

1782
01:58:18,719 --> 01:58:21,153
I need to get to the airport.

1783
01:58:22,856 --> 01:58:24,380
Stupid...!

1784
01:58:30,064 --> 01:58:32,055
Vladimir! Let me get my whip.

1785
01:58:35,602 --> 01:58:38,969
You know I always
wanna answer yours first...

1786
01:58:41,342 --> 01:58:42,934
Oh! Just... Let's do...

1787
01:58:43,677 --> 01:58:46,840
I never had a inkling before.
I didn't know what to do with it.

1788
01:58:47,014 --> 01:58:49,073
Shoot, we gotta get to the...

1789
01:58:49,249 --> 01:58:52,980
It's stupid. Stupid seat belt!

1790
01:59:00,761 --> 01:59:03,195
Oh, there's a...
Hold it, there's a finger in there.

1791
01:59:03,797 --> 01:59:04,957
You on Facebook?

1792
01:59:06,100 --> 01:59:08,534
I can't hear out of this ear.

1793
01:59:10,270 --> 01:59:11,760
Are you guys on Facebook?

1794
01:59:11,939 --> 01:59:14,840
I never had a inkling before.
I didn't know what to do with it.

1795
01:59:15,008 --> 01:59:18,068
All right. I gotta get to the airport.

1796
01:59:18,245 --> 01:59:22,079
She's probably at the gate by now.

1797
01:59:22,249 --> 01:59:23,273
How did you do that?

1798
01:59:29,823 --> 01:59:31,814
- Hey, I'm Taylor.
- And I'm Taylor. Too.

1799
01:59:31,992 --> 01:59:34,688
Yeah. It's confusing. Yeah, we know that.

1800
01:59:34,862 --> 01:59:36,352
Marker.

1801
01:59:36,530 --> 01:59:38,327
If you look out the window,
ma'am...

1802
01:59:38,499 --> 01:59:40,023
...we're passing
the famous Rodeo Drive.

1803
01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:43,601
- Have you ever shopped here?
- I did once, actually.

1804
01:59:43,771 --> 01:59:47,832
But, big mistake. Big. Huge.
