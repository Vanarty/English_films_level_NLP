1
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:47,506
One continent on our planet changes

2
00:00:47,632 --> 00:00:49,550
more dramatically than any other.

3
00:00:58,893 --> 00:00:59,852
North America.

4
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:05,316
Whole landscapes here can be transformed
in a matter of minutes.

5
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:28,089
And all life has to be ready
to seize the moment.

6
00:01:28,214 --> 00:01:31,175
Getting it wrong can be disastrous.

7
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:37,056
But time it correctly,
and there can be great rewards.

8
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,855
This is a land of opportunity.

9
00:01:51,696 --> 00:01:54,949
Over 100 times the size of Great Britain,

10
00:01:55,074 --> 00:02:00,538
North America stretches from just above
the equator almost to the North Pole.

11
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:09,005
Temperatures can range
from 50 degrees Celsius to minus 40.

12
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:26,188
The coldest wilderness of all
lies in the Arctic north.

13
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:39,952
Here, in Canada's Yukon Territory,
winter is brutal.

14
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:55,009
Many animals have travelled south
to avoid the worst of the cold.

15
00:02:59,472 --> 00:03:01,891
For those which stay behind,

16
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:05,269
life becomes very hard indeed.

17
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,984
A Canadian lynx.

18
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:21,827
No other kind of cat, anywhere,

19
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,580
lives farther north than this one.

20
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:36,133
The search for food could take him
hundreds of miles.

21
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,407
A snowshoe hare.

22
00:04:03,536 --> 00:04:05,746
This could be a chance.

23
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:23,597
He's lost the element of surprise.

24
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:32,440
And now there's a tangle of branches
between him and his prey.

25
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:07,099
Missed again.

26
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:11,187
More of his energy wasted.

27
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:27,495
Another hare.

28
00:05:30,206 --> 00:05:32,041
This time, out in the open.

29
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,529
And another failure.

30
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:15,584
If he doesn't kill soon,
he may not survive these winter months.

31
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:32,851
But in North America,

32
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:35,479
change is never far away.

33
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:51,829
April - and billions of tonnes of snow
and ice are starting to melt,

34
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:53,497
bringing new opportunities.

35
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,629
Much of the water drains southwards.

36
00:07:02,298 --> 00:07:07,886
10,000 creeks join, forming
North America's biggest river system.

37
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:16,562
The meltwaters travel 2,000 miles
down the Mississippi,

38
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:19,481
right through the heart of North America.

39
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:29,700
In the streams of Tennessee,
river chub are getting ready to breed.

40
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:46,258
This male is busy building
a mound of stones, in which,

41
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:49,887
if he's lucky,
a female will lay her eggs.

42
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,028
As the river flows faster,
the work gets harder.

43
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:27,466
It's a good start,
but rivals are doing the same thing

44
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:30,803
and want some of his pebbles.

45
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,405
The intruder seen off,

46
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,408
and it's back to business.

47
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:06,505
A few finishing touches.

48
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:26,859
And then, with the last
of some 7,000 stones,

49
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:30,195
his nest is complete.

50
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:39,705
And right on time, here is a female.

51
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,377
But the mound now needs one last feature.

52
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:55,929
A trench where she can lay her eggs.

53
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:20,412
And with a gentle shimmy of his body,
he nudges her into position.

54
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,929
And she deposits her eggs

55
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:41,892
where they will be safe
from both currents and predators.

56
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:51,568
H is work is done.

57
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:55,906
The eggs will hatch, and then his mound
will be slowly dismantled

58
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:57,825
by the current.

59
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:02,246
So next year,
he'll have to start all over again.

60
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:12,798
Spring is now well on its way.

61
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:21,223
North America is wonderfully rich
in wild flowers.

62
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:25,811
There are over 10,000 species of them.

63
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:47,916
Hummingbirds fly up from the south
to feast on the nectar.

64
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:07,477
Along the North American coast,
the tides are the largest in the world.

65
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:17,112
The fragmented shoreline forces
sea water to rush up narrow inlets.

66
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:26,622
And each time the tide retreats,
it opens a freshly stocked larder.

67
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:41,011
7,000 square miles of extra coastline

68
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:45,182
is uncovered in the space of just
two hours.

69
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:09,247
A mother black bear is looking
for something suitable for her cubs.

70
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:15,003
This is their first-ever trip
to the seaside.

71
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:31,520
In a few hours, the tide will return.

72
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:37,401
So, they must keep up with Mum.

73
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,344
Here's something tasty -

74
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,013
crabs.

75
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:21,695
Big crabs can give a nasty nip.

76
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:26,324
So, it's best to start off
with smaller ones.

77
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:33,290
During spring, three quarters
of the bears' food comes from the beach.

78
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:13,246
But now, this family is not alone.

79
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:22,422
An adult male.

80
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:26,426
He's double her size,
and they're in his territory.

81
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,683
The cubs know that call.

82
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,228
It's time to head for safety.

83
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:47,489
Bears have poor eyesight,
but their sense of smell is acute,

84
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,659
and the male has detected intruders.

85
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:04,464
He knows exactly which tree they are in.

86
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:09,261
If the cubs stay up there,
they'll be safe,

87
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:11,888
but they're losing precious feeding time.

88
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:21,231
For now,
he's content to leave his scent mark.

89
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:28,697
A warning note for trespassers.

90
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:34,286
The family moves on.

91
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:41,501
For the cubs, lunch today
will have to be a takeaway.

92
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,098
The tide comes in.

93
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:03,607
And within minutes,
feeding time is over for another day.

94
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:12,199
As the continent warms,

95
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:15,243
on a few special nights,

96
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:18,121
when the temperature is just right...

97
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:24,169
...the forests of North America
put on a show.

98
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,145
Male fireflies are taking to the air.

99
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:48,610
These insects are not, in fact, flies,
they're a kind of beetle.

100
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:55,992
The light produced by the males
is the most energy-efficient on Earth.

101
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,877
Some species synchronise their flashes

102
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:09,089
to increase the visibility of the message.

103
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:22,769
If a female sees something she likes,

104
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:24,896
she returns the signal.

105
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:38,785
It looks as if the message is working.

106
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:54,551
But the forest is booby trapped...

107
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,930
...by orb-weaver spiders.

108
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:25,749
The firefly continues to glow,
even in death.

109
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:35,592
Other males see the flashes,
but not the dangers.

110
00:19:55,653 --> 00:20:00,033
The spider's larder is filling up.

111
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,760
But for every firefly that gets caught,

112
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:21,763
thousands avoid the traps.

113
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:34,526
And this male is lucky.

114
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,530
He's found a mate.

115
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:50,083
And over the course of the night,

116
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,919
millions will pair up.

117
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:14,899
There are over 150 different species
of fireflies in North America,

118
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:17,569
and each has its own flash code.

119
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:38,339
Once they're mated, the females
deposit their eggs in the ground.

120
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:41,384
And for those that didn't find a mate,

121
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:45,472
their one chance has come and gone.

122
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:10,747
Little rain reaches
the heart of the continent.

123
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:20,381
For over a million square miles,
there's not a tree in sight.

124
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:41,027
Many of those living here
spend much of their time underground.

125
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:53,623
A prairie dog - a kind of large,
burrowing squirrel.

126
00:22:57,627 --> 00:23:02,298
Sentinels keep watch,
ready to warn others of any danger.

127
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:10,014
And at this time of year
is a new generation to protect.

128
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:14,477
This mother has six pups.

129
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:23,486
The youngsters constantly beg for food.

130
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:29,993
After all,
the pups aren't great at sharing.

131
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:41,170
But the prairie dogs don't have
the prairies to themselves.

132
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:44,632
An American badger.

133
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:48,761
The pups have never seen one before.

134
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:57,770
And badgers eat pups.

135
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:02,817
A burrowing owl.

136
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:05,653
It also knows that badgers are dangerous.

137
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:18,666
It, too, has young and does not want
the badger anywhere near them.

138
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:32,347
Eventually, the badger gives up.

139
00:24:45,193 --> 00:24:47,612
He sets off to look elsewhere.

140
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:54,911
If he can find a place
where the grass is higher than he is,

141
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:57,163
he will have a better chance.

142
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,487
The mother sounds the alarm.

143
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,991
Adults know the danger all too well.

144
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:51,551
Four pups make it to safety below.

145
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,097
But their mother dare not
wait above ground any longer.

146
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:36,387
Half of all prairie dog pups
don't survive to adulthood.

147
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:53,988
Predators are not the only problem
faced by animals

148
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:56,199
living on these great plains.

149
00:27:00,161 --> 00:27:05,416
Warm air sweeps up from the Gulf of Mexico
and across the open prairies.

150
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:10,797
And here, with no mountains to block it,

151
00:27:10,922 --> 00:27:13,633
it meets the frigid air from the Arctic.

152
00:27:18,221 --> 00:27:20,640
The results are spectacular.

153
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:33,319
As the air currents mix and swirl,

154
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:36,864
they build into one of nature's most
fearsome forces.

155
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,748
Tornados.

156
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:54,507
These twisters spin at speeds
of up to 300 miles an hour,

157
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:56,300
the world's fastest wind.

158
00:28:05,685 --> 00:28:10,648
Over 1,000 tornadoes
touch down here every year.

159
00:28:46,893 --> 00:28:49,353
These drenching summer storms

160
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:54,817
are prevented from spreading westwards
by the Rocky Mountains.

161
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:58,905
Some peaks are over four kilometres high.

162
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:04,327
So, beyond them, to the west,
much of the land remains parched.

163
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:15,588
The great American deserts
cover over a million square miles.

164
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:28,517
Here, roasted by the sun and blasted
by the wind, the rocks disintegrate,

165
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:34,273
and mountains, particle by particle,
are reduced to sand.

166
00:29:47,912 --> 00:29:54,418
These pillars are all that remain
of a plateau where dinosaurs once roamed.

167
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:02,468
Few animals can now survive here.

168
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:14,480
In summer, as in all deserts,

169
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:16,565
the enemy is heat,

170
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:18,901
and it returns every day.

171
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,283
At seven in the morning,

172
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:30,121
the temperature
is already 25 degrees Celsius.

173
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:32,790
The clock is ticking

174
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:36,377
for one unusual descendant
of the dinosaurs.

175
00:30:56,397 --> 00:30:58,357
A roadrunner.

176
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:03,070
Found only in the deserts
of North America.

177
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:08,409
Built for a life on the ground.

178
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:13,539
He can run at over 20 miles an hour.

179
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:18,961
But the prey he seeks are one step ahead.

180
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:46,655
The roadrunner's challenge
is picking the right target.

181
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:04,965
A Gila monster -

182
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:06,884
too big.

183
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:19,021
By mid-morning,
it will be 40 degrees Celsius.

184
00:32:20,481 --> 00:32:24,110
Even the smallest lizards
will soon head for cover.

185
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,420
A centipede.

186
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,842
Slim pickings for a morning's work.

187
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:57,726
Hunting should get easier

188
00:32:57,852 --> 00:32:59,728
and prey will stay out longer

189
00:32:59,854 --> 00:33:03,440
once the summer's peak begins to fade.

190
00:33:19,206 --> 00:33:23,335
On the East Coast,
summer is coming to an end.

191
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:29,216
Cold currents are sweeping
along the coast of Florida.

192
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:39,768
And with them,
come grey mullet on their migration

193
00:33:39,894 --> 00:33:41,687
to their spawning grounds in the south.

194
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:52,907
Millions of them -

195
00:33:53,032 --> 00:33:58,495
and packed so tightly,
they stain the water like an oil slick.

196
00:34:00,873 --> 00:34:04,585
Few people on the beach
are even aware of them.

197
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:15,971
The mullet keep as close
to the shore as possible,

198
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:17,932
for in deeper water, there are predators.

199
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:23,812
Close to the beach,

200
00:34:23,938 --> 00:34:27,024
they have to keep clear of human swimmers.

201
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:37,743
But now hunters from the open ocean
have detected them.

202
00:34:45,209 --> 00:34:50,631
Tarpon - over two metres long
and weighing over 100 kilograms.

203
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:04,770
To get close to the mullet
in the shallows,

204
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:07,147
the tarpon turn on their sides.

205
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:10,651
Now the mullet can't see
their shining silver flanks

206
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:12,569
until it's too late.

207
00:35:21,704 --> 00:35:23,205
And feasting begins.

208
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:44,727
Black-tipped shark arrive.

209
00:35:47,396 --> 00:35:50,107
Pelicans join in.

210
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:17,593
But these attacks have little effect
on the immense shoals.

211
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:23,390
The mullet outnumber their enemies
by 10,000 to one.

212
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:30,105
So, the great procession travels on,
into the Northern Atlantic Ocean,

213
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:34,234
where, at last,
they will be able to spawn in safety.

214
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:42,159
Autumn arrives in North America.

215
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:48,791
No mountain range spans the continent
from east to west,

216
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:52,544
so there is nothing to stop cold air
from the Arctic

217
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:56,548
sweeping down unhindered
as far south as Louisiana.

218
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:13,732
Autumn brings colour
to the southern swamps.

219
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:44,680
Here, it has been hot and humid
for most of the year,

220
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:49,810
and now these sub-zero temperatures
are something of a trial

221
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:52,354
for the local inhabitants.

222
00:37:53,564 --> 00:37:55,983
An American alligator.

223
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:19,590
The alligator reacts to the chill
by slowing its heart rate

224
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:22,092
to barely one beat per minute.

225
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:25,721
It's a kind of energy-saving winter sleep.

226
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:33,270
But other creatures
don't have this ability.

227
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:38,567
The largest inhabitants of the swamp.

228
00:38:40,694 --> 00:38:44,031
A relative of the elephant.

229
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:48,202
A manatee.

230
00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:57,044
A female provides milk for her calf
from a teat behind her flipper.

231
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:04,551
She might be able to survive the chill...

232
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:08,263
...but her calf cannot.

233
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:24,905
So every autumn,
they need to find warmer waters.

234
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,993
They have a long journey ahead -

235
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:32,371
it could be hundreds of miles.

236
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:54,560
And she is not alone.

237
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:17,249
The warm waters they need to survive
come from an unusual source.

238
00:40:17,374 --> 00:40:20,127
An immense underground river

239
00:40:20,252 --> 00:40:24,756
flows through subterranean channels
in Florida's rocks.

240
00:40:26,675 --> 00:40:31,638
In places, it comes to the surface,
creating over a thousand springs.

241
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:38,812
Now, in winter,

242
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:42,733
these springs are ten degrees warmer
than the surrounding waters.

243
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:52,409
So manatees come here every year
from far and wide.

244
00:41:02,044 --> 00:41:04,796
And here they can relax.

245
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:13,972
They can get their backs scrubbed.

246
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:21,813
And they socialise.

247
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:27,444
No-one is in much of a hurry.

248
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:41,958
And young manatees have a chance
to meet some surprising neighbours.

249
00:41:46,505 --> 00:41:51,843
In summer, playing with an alligator
might be a dangerous game.

250
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:58,100
But now, at any rate,

251
00:41:58,225 --> 00:42:03,271
the giant reptiles are still too chilled
to react with any vigour.

252
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:25,585
Without these warm pools,

253
00:42:25,711 --> 00:42:29,881
few of Florida's manatees
would be able to survive the winter.

254
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:37,347
But the waterways here
are now very popular with people, too,

255
00:42:37,472 --> 00:42:42,561
and many manatees carry scars inflicted
by the propellers of boats.

256
00:42:44,813 --> 00:42:48,233
Her calf has already had its first scrape.

257
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:54,614
Every year, more than 100 manatees die
from human causes.

258
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,960
As the human population of Florida grows,

259
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:10,505
so wildlife is coming
under increasing pressure.

260
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:15,802
Across North America,

261
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:19,765
a million acres of wilderness
are lost every decade.

262
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:40,118
But it is in the far north
of the continent

263
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:44,623
that human beings
are affecting wildlife most critically.

264
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:50,754
Canada is warming faster
than any other country on Earth.

265
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:11,274
Polar bears have always relied
on sea ice for their hunting.

266
00:44:16,613 --> 00:44:19,533
But summers are now getting longer
and hotter.

267
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:24,746
For most polar bears,

268
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:27,123
this is a time of starvation.

269
00:44:39,928 --> 00:44:41,805
On the shores of Hudson Bay,

270
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:45,559
some bears are finding
a new source of food.

271
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:58,238
They're all looking for the same thing,

272
00:44:58,363 --> 00:45:00,824
and they have their own ways
of catching it.

273
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:13,086
First, they must find the right rock.

274
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:26,057
Now they must wait.

275
00:45:36,693 --> 00:45:42,032
The tide comes in,
bringing with it other northern giants.

276
00:46:02,886 --> 00:46:04,346
Beluga whales.

277
00:46:08,308 --> 00:46:10,894
Close to the shore,

278
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:16,650
their calves should be safe
from ocean-going predators such as orca.

279
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:21,488
Over 3,000 whales have gathered here.

280
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:40,715
A young male makes his move.

281
00:46:49,516 --> 00:46:52,811
Polar bears are skilled marine hunters...

282
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:58,441
...and beluga are slow swimmers.

283
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:44,404
As long as a whale
can keep an eye on a hunting bear,

284
00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:45,989
it should be safe.

285
00:48:01,296 --> 00:48:03,548
This young bear is still learning.

286
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:15,268
More experienced bears
know to be patient.

287
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:34,871
Success will depend
on split-second timing.

288
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:25,797
A bite at the back of the head,
and the kill is swift.

289
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:38,601
This extraordinary behaviour
has only been reported here,

290
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:41,813
in this remote corner of North America...

291
00:49:44,524 --> 00:49:46,693
...and only in the last few years.

292
00:49:55,577 --> 00:50:00,248
This one small group of bears
has found an ingenious way

293
00:50:00,373 --> 00:50:03,793
of surviving the lean summer months.

294
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:22,020
But for others, it is not so easy.

295
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:28,484
We continue to transform our planet,

296
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:31,362
and the seasons
are becoming less predictable.

297
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:38,995
Will the wildlife of North America
be able to adapt?

298
00:50:40,288 --> 00:50:45,210
Not only on this continent,
known for its change,

299
00:50:45,335 --> 00:50:47,545
but in a rapidly changing world.

300
00:51:02,185 --> 00:51:03,436
Next time...

301
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:11,694
...the continent where wildlife
puts on the greatest show on Earth.

302
00:51:22,914 --> 00:51:24,540
Africa.
