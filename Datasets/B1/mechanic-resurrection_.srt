1
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,592
Mr. Santos, so good to see you.

2
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,358
We saved your usual table, Mr. Santos.

3
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,350
Thank you.

4
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,310
My pleasure.

5
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,711
Nice to see you, Otto.

6
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,871
Thank you.

7
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:30,628
Five months in Brazil.

8
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,296
You're a hard man to find.

9
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,476
I don't speak English.

10
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:38,386
You even have the accent right.

11
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,555
If you say so.

12
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:44,809
I do say so.

13
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:48,020
The principal I represent
has an offer for you.

14
00:03:48,104 --> 00:03:49,897
He would like three men killed.

15
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,400
Each death must look like an accident.

16
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:54,026
Your specialty, I believe.

17
00:03:55,945 --> 00:04:01,409
Seems that reports of your demise
have been greatly exaggerated.

18
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:05,746
My principal could make that known
to certain interested parties.

19
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:12,086
Which means that your new life here
would end rather quickly.

20
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:16,090
Or you can do the job
and go back to being dead.

21
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:19,093
What's your pleasure,
Senor Otto Santos?

22
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:24,723
Let me make a call.

23
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,561
What are you doing?

24
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,816
Tell your principal it never pays
to fuck with the dead.

25
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,047
Get the fuck on the ground!

26
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,674
Get the fuck down!
Don't look at me!

27
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,958
KOH LIPE, SOUTHERN THAILAND

28
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:53,700
- Bishop.
- Hello, Mei.

29
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,745
You're different.

30
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,122
Older.

31
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:01,375
Um, something more than that.

32
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,503
I need time to find someone
before they find me.

33
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,755
Then I'll be moving on.

34
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,507
Who else is here?

35
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,343
No one. Diving season's over.

36
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:12,678
Come.

37
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,513
Your home's waiting for you.

38
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,265
How was your trip?

39
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,724
It was okay.

40
00:09:20,144 --> 00:09:22,771
It was a busy season.

41
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:26,233
But don't worry,
no one came near your home.

42
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,201
Nothing's changed.

43
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:37,494
Get some rest.

44
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:12,965
Hi. How can I help you?

45
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:14,299
Great, you speak English.

46
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:16,718
Um, I'm running low on first aid.

47
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:18,303
I'm staying on a boat.

48
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:20,514
Sure.

49
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:26,061
This is all I have.

50
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:27,980
Thanks.

51
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:37,197
If I don't have what you need,
I can call our supply boat.

52
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,367
They can take you back
to Phuket to get it.

53
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:44,538
No, this is great.
Thanks so much.

54
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:45,706
Anytime.

55
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:06,810
Bishop!

56
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,146
Bishop!

57
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:13,108
They're fighting. It's bad.

58
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,257
You want a piece of me?

59
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:20,323
Stay down.

60
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,251
I've met her.
She has a backbone.

61
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:34,546
Women like that
get killed in these situations.

62
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,215
Domestic squabble, Mei.

63
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:38,842
Not my business.

64
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,929
You helped me once.

65
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:45,098
Help her.

66
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:47,684
Or I will do it.

67
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:54,566
Hold this.

68
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:31,978
Frank, get the fuck away from me!

69
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,064
Frank!

70
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,315
Not worth it.

71
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,360
Bitch.

72
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,532
Let her go.

73
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,033
Who the fuck are you?

74
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:46,618
Please, help me.

75
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:51,832
I said, let her go. Last chance.

76
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,875
Let go of me, Frank.

77
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:55,001
You don't want to do that.

78
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:56,795
Fuck you!

79
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:16,356
Is he dead?

80
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:24,865
Bishop.

81
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:29,953
Shit.

82
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,377
Take her ashore.
I'll deal with the boat.

83
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,545
Okay.

84
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,158
- Bishop.
- Where is she?

85
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:51,952
Sleeping. In your bungalow.

86
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,837
What's going on?

87
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:05,507
Gina Thornton. American.

88
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,467
- That's you, right?
- Yeah.

89
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,929
You're the second woman
who has my picture in her phone.

90
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,014
The first was working
for a guy called Crain.

91
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:15,350
Name ring a bell?

92
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:18,270
The only thing
you got right was my name.

93
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:19,896
The first woman was a messenger.

94
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,191
Is that what you are?

95
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:25,235
So what's the message?

96
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,528
I already told you...

97
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,280
Tell me about Crain.

98
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:29,823
What are you supposed to do for him?

99
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,074
Where is he?

100
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:37,789
Fine. I'll talk.

101
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:47,716
Look... I don't work for Crain.

102
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,260
That's the truth.
But he did send me.

103
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:52,220
Where is he?

104
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:54,264
- I don't know.
- Why are you here?

105
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,851
He has something on me.

106
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,102
I had no choice.

107
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:00,687
Right.

108
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,397
Any of his men nearby?

109
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,024
He didn't say, I didn't ask.

110
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:05,859
What about Frank?

111
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:06,985
Part of the setup.

112
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:09,321
Explain.

113
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:13,408
He was supposed to get me,
and I escaped to this island.

114
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,035
It wasn't meant to be real.

115
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:17,454
But then Frank got drunk
and attacked me.

116
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,748
Crain wanted me to look like a victim.

117
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:21,374
And get next to me?

118
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,752
Yeah.

119
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:25,920
But Frank took his part too far.

120
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:28,631
So we meet. What next?

121
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,426
I use the cell and call
the pre-programmed number.

122
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:34,512
Let it ring once.
After that, I don't know.

123
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:37,682
My new girl gets kidnapped is what.

124
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:39,100
What?

125
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:40,977
The thought didn't cross your mind?

126
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,902
Okay, so you fall for me,
and Crain thinks he has leverage on you.

127
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,487
Why?

128
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,031
Well, to force me to do something
I don't want to do.

129
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:56,409
What is it that you do?

130
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,953
I'll make the call, not you.
I choose when they come.

131
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:01,039
Then I'll take Crain out.

132
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:04,542
No. I'm not going to
help you kill anyone.

133
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:06,461
Do you really believe that Crain

134
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,089
lets the people he blackmails
into helping him live?

135
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:14,094
I've spent my whole life
setting people up to die.

136
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:16,971
I can set you up to live.

137
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,831
My father was a doctor
of Eastern medicine.

138
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:44,290
He was a healer.

139
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,460
Bishop used to study with him.

140
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:49,963
To learn how to heal?

141
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,590
A man like him?

142
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:54,050
I thought so, too.

143
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:58,638
But my father understood

144
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:04,477
that those who have been hurt the most
often have the greatest ability to heal.

145
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:00,617
<i>Eighteen months ago,

146
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,537
<i>special military operative Gina Thornton
left the war zone in Afghanistan

147
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:07,624
<i>to offer humanitarian
assistance in Cambodia.

148
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,668
<i>After my last deployment,
I just needed a change.

149
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:14,506
<i>Too many innocent people
getting caught in the line of fire.

150
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,758
<i>Rules of engagement
made it impossible to prevent.

151
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:24,140
<i>And then, you know,
when I came to Phnom Penh, I, uh,

152
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:27,060
<i>I don't know, it just felt right here.

153
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:32,774
<i>And, um, I felt like I can maybe
do something good with my life.

154
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,335
I can't afford any surprises.

155
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,087
Need to know what Crain has on you.

156
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:04,597
I run a shelter for victims
of human trafficking in Cambodia.

157
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:08,726
There's always been an issue or two,
but I've managed to handle it.

158
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:15,984
A few weeks ago,
one of my staff members was kidnapped.

159
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:21,489
Two days later, she was
thrown off a truck at my front door.

160
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:24,492
Beaten. Died within an hour.

161
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:31,165
Crain sent this asshole, Jeremy,
who said it was just a taste

162
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:34,127
of what he'd do
to everyone at the shelter.

163
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,422
Including the children.

164
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:41,718
They are my weakness.
All the leverage Crain needed.

165
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:49,684
So, you see, I didn't have a choice.
I had to do what Crain wanted me to.

166
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:05,718
- What are you doing?
- Hold my hand.

167
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:07,845
It's for Crain's people.

168
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:09,347
They're watching.

169
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,431
Where?

170
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:13,851
Two men in a Zodiac.

171
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:15,144
Out in the ocean.

172
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:28,533
There you are.
Come on, you two.

173
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:30,451
You're gonna miss the best part.

174
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:32,370
Give me your hands.

175
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:40,211
Hold this, please.

176
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:42,272
- We can just get a drink and...
- No, you will not.

177
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:43,649
- You will stay right there.
- Mei...

178
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:46,134
- Thank you very much.
- What are you doing?

179
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:49,137
All couples have to be tied together.

180
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,930
But we're not a couple.

181
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:53,766
You sure looked like it on the beach.

182
00:24:00,356 --> 00:24:03,860
So, um, do you go to weddings a lot?

183
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,699
Not my idea of a good time.

184
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:11,576
Me neither.

185
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:12,702
Here.

186
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:15,788
We supposed to drink this?

187
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,915
No. Put your fingertips in it

188
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:22,378
and place three dots
on each other's foreheads for good luck.

189
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:24,714
- Enjoy.
- I could use some good luck.

190
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,007
"Enjoy"?

191
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,770
Okay, my turn.

192
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:40,573
Come on, let's just get a drink.
Leave that.

193
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:42,565
All right. One second.

194
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:47,904
This is a great look for you.

195
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,336
You missed a spot.

196
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:09,509
It's really kind of stuck.

197
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:12,595
Okay, okay.

198
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:15,056
Next time, use your shoe.

199
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:25,942
I love this song.

200
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:30,071
- This a Thai song?
- Yeah.

201
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,114
It's so good.

202
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:37,787
Wanna dance?

203
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,792
No, don't worry.

204
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,044
I don't... I don't
want to dance with you.

205
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,712
What, you think I'm a bad dancer?

206
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:49,590
You look like you're a terrible dancer.

207
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:18,661
Hey.

208
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:26,168
I, um, just wanted to
thank you for everything.

209
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:29,088
Everything?

210
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:41,601
And I wanted to apologize for
getting you into this mess.

211
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:49,400
Those kids are everything to me.

212
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:53,779
If they get trafficked or...
Or killed...

213
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:58,284
...I couldn't bear it.

214
00:27:00,328 --> 00:27:01,829
I understand.

215
00:27:07,418 --> 00:27:08,628
I was an orphan, too.

216
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:16,177
I was sold to an East End gangster who
specialized in training child soldiers.

217
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,678
Crain was there, too.

218
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:20,765
What happened?

219
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:24,143
I escaped, he didn't.

220
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:29,148
No doubt they blamed him.

221
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:30,816
Took it out in blood.

222
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:34,445
So now he blames you.

223
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:38,032
Yeah, this is his payback.

224
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:43,871
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

225
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,248
It's not your fault.

226
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:28,142
What are we gonna do?

227
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:36,150
I worked it out.

228
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:39,987
Supply boat from the back side
of the island, out of view.

229
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,947
By tomorrow night,
you'll be out of danger.

230
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:43,657
Your kids, too.

231
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:45,451
It's all arranged.

232
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:47,620
What about Crain?

233
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:49,872
I'm not doing his three kills.

234
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:56,337
Once you're safe,
there's only going to be one. Him.

235
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,422
But they'll never let you near him.

236
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:01,842
They'll never know I was there.

237
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:08,724
I want you to hold on
to something for me.

238
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:10,351
Until I come back.

239
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:16,106
My father gave this to me.

240
00:30:17,525 --> 00:30:19,485
It's the only memory I have of him.

241
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:25,991
I'll keep it safe.

242
00:31:02,403 --> 00:31:03,737
That's Crain's guy.

243
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:05,781
Look at me.

244
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:08,742
Remember, I'll make sure
they get you home.

245
00:31:08,826 --> 00:31:09,910
Trust me.

246
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:32,725
Bishop!

247
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:35,311
Bishop!

248
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,897
- Help!
- Go!

249
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:43,068
Bishop!

250
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:44,528
Bishop!

251
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:55,122
Mr. Crain, I have him right here.

252
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,586
Tell me how to find you
face-to-face.

253
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:35,537
Are we done?

254
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:37,831
Follow me.

255
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:50,719
Sit down.

256
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:58,519
Please, don't move.

257
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:01,188
I'd listen to her
if I were you, Arthur.

258
00:33:02,523 --> 00:33:04,274
No need for guards or guns

259
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:06,777
when the man you want's
sitting on a pound of Semtex.

260
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,821
How did you find me, Riah?

261
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:11,365
What, no, "Hello.
Nice to see you after all these years"?

262
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:16,745
But then, you always were
one for getting down to business.

263
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:19,415
How did I find you?

264
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,250
You should know better
than anyone, Arthur,

265
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,293
there's no privacy anymore.

266
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:25,170
Not with wonderful things like

267
00:33:25,254 --> 00:33:28,340
facial recognition
and satellite tracking.

268
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:32,720
I'm going to give you something
I never give anyone,

269
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:34,763
chance to walk away.

270
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:37,433
Give me the girl and walk away.

271
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,603
I see you've developed
a sense of humor over the years.

272
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:46,233
But if it's all the same, no,
I need you. You're the best.

273
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:50,237
Open it.

274
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:55,451
I need you to eliminate three people.

275
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:56,910
And this is the first.

276
00:33:56,994 --> 00:34:00,205
His name is Krill.
Mass-murderer and warlord.

277
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:04,168
He's also the highest-profile
arms dealer in Africa.

278
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:07,337
He's imprisoned
on Penjara Kaedah in Malaysia.

279
00:34:07,421 --> 00:34:09,840
His imprisonment
is what keeps him secure.

280
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:12,843
It's impossible for his enemies
to get to him.

281
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,471
And this?

282
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,699
It's important that you
swallow it only after the kill,

283
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:20,893
or the fuel cell will degrade
and we'll never find you.

284
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:22,478
Where's Gina?

285
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:26,482
Do the three kills, Arthur.
Get the girl back.

286
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:29,860
Even if you don't love her,
you at least owe her, no?

287
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:32,404
I mean, she's in this shit
because of you.

288
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:34,656
How do I know you'll keep her alive?

289
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,868
Finish your kill, get a video call.

290
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:40,704
After the last one, you'll receive
instructions where to find her.

291
00:34:40,788 --> 00:34:42,581
And your word's good, is it?

292
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:45,584
Good heavens, absolutely not.

293
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:49,254
But I do have a very keen
sense of self-preservation.

294
00:34:49,338 --> 00:34:52,758
I know that cheating you
will only make me your target.

295
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:55,636
And since that concludes
our business for the moment,

296
00:34:56,929 --> 00:35:00,265
I wish you <i>bonne chance.

297
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:34,216
Let's get moving, sweetheart, come on.

298
00:35:36,218 --> 00:35:37,511
Come on, let's go.

299
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:51,817
<i>The prison is 70 miles out to sea,

300
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,696
<i>set atop cliffs
more than 100 meters high

301
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:58,574
<i>and surrounded by shark-infested waters.

302
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:03,120
<i>So, basically impossible to get in,
and nobody has ever gotten out.

303
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:05,914
<i>It will be even harder to get your man.

304
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:10,377
<i>He's surrounded at all times
by his team of loyal soldiers.

305
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,838
<i>Getting him alone
will be your main challenge.

306
00:36:54,129 --> 00:36:56,048
Shark repellent. Yes, sir.

307
00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:01,303
Thank you.

308
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:12,940
It's powerful stuff.

309
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:14,524
Hope you know what you're doing.

310
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:44,781
- Hey!
- Hey, you!

311
00:38:44,865 --> 00:38:47,534
What? What?
What do you want, huh?

312
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:49,911
- Hey, stop.
- Yeah, right.

313
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:51,747
- Stop.
- Fuck you.

314
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:04,551
Martin Basman,
you are under arrest.

315
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,716
Line up!

316
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,390
Go.

317
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,679
Go.

318
00:39:54,351 --> 00:39:55,727
Thank you.

319
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,033
Keep going!

320
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:30,929
<i>Bishop, remember,
it has to look like an accident.

321
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:35,809
<i>If he dies with a knife in his back,
no one will be there to pick you up.

322
00:40:38,812 --> 00:40:40,564
<i>Good luck.

323
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:07,174
- Who the hell is that?
- Krill.

324
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:13,889
He was an executioner for people like
Charles Taylor and the Sudanese militia.

325
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:16,850
People say he ate
the hearts of his victims.

326
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:21,521
Some have relatives who want revenge.

327
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:25,275
Like that guy over there.

328
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:28,361
He used to be Krill's best assassin.

329
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:31,531
Now all he wants to do is kill him.

330
00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:35,619
But he has his bodyguards
constantly protecting him.

331
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:20,056
You are a good man.

332
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:23,268
Why don't you join us for dinner?

333
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:27,856
I'm not sure I like the company.

334
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:32,527
Then they are not invited.

335
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:06,978
Hey. Come, come.

336
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:08,855
Come in, my friend.

337
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:15,487
There are six murders
and 23 stabbings every week

338
00:44:17,072 --> 00:44:18,948
in this shithole.

339
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:20,992
Most of them pointed at me.

340
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:26,331
That guy you stopped,
he used to work for me.

341
00:44:27,082 --> 00:44:28,583
Oh.

342
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,127
Maybe he is still upset
that I killed his brother.

343
00:44:34,464 --> 00:44:39,761
Loyalty is a scarce commodity
in my line of business.

344
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:45,517
Oh, yes.

345
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,186
How did you know
that he would want to kill me?

346
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,480
I hear things.

347
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:53,608
My juju tells me everything
that I need to hear.

348
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:56,903
Maybe you weren't listening hard enough.

349
00:45:01,825 --> 00:45:03,576
Do you know who I am?

350
00:45:04,953 --> 00:45:06,121
Krill.

351
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:08,540
You run this place.

352
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:11,000
Exactly.

353
00:45:11,084 --> 00:45:16,506
And when I get out of this place,
I'm going to run all of Africa.

354
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:19,259
There could be a job
for a man like you.

355
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,597
I already have a job.

356
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:26,683
- What job?
- You.

357
00:46:38,922 --> 00:46:40,715
Let the man pray.

358
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:42,045
Here he comes.

359
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,890
He's right below us.

360
00:48:54,057 --> 00:48:55,933
Bring up the net.

361
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:16,287
Nothing in the net, sir.

362
00:49:16,371 --> 00:49:19,374
What the fuck?

363
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:21,042
Looking for someone?

364
00:49:22,919 --> 00:49:24,462
I want my call.

365
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:31,177
Well, Bishop survived.

366
00:49:40,311 --> 00:49:41,396
<i>Hello, Arthur.

367
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:42,647
Happy now?

368
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:44,732
<i>Nice work on Krill.

369
00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:46,776
Prison food'll kill you.

370
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,487
Put Gina on.

371
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:51,072
<i>Here's your boyfriend.

372
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:52,532
<i>Hi.

373
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:53,908
How are you holding up?

374
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,576
<i>I'm okay.

375
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:59,872
<i>Crain wanted me to let you know that,
um, you have 36 hours

376
00:49:59,956 --> 00:50:03,584
<i>to eliminate the next target,
or they will eliminate me.

377
00:50:04,544 --> 00:50:06,421
That won't happen.

378
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:09,132
<i>Okay, this is all very sweet, Arthur.

379
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:11,175
<i>But you heard what she said.

380
00:50:11,259 --> 00:50:13,219
<i>You need to pick up the pace.

381
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:16,055
<i>This is your next kill.
Adrian Cook.

382
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:38,745
Did Bishop tell you where he got this?

383
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:44,417
It belonged to his father.

384
00:50:46,294 --> 00:50:49,338
I never saw him take it off. Never.

385
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:52,383
You know, I wasn't sure
there was anything

386
00:50:52,467 --> 00:50:54,302
in the world that could break Arthur

387
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:57,847
until I saw you wearing this watch.

388
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:00,266
Now I know he'll do anything for you.

389
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,555
SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA

390
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:24,540
<i>In the heart of downtown Sydney,
atop a 58-story high-rise,

391
00:51:24,624 --> 00:51:27,710
<i>is the penthouse suite
owned by Adrian Cook,

392
00:51:27,794 --> 00:51:30,254
<i>the mining and minerals billionaire.

393
00:51:30,338 --> 00:51:32,089
<i>Few people know that he originally

394
00:51:32,173 --> 00:51:37,261
<i>made his fortune in human trafficking,
specializing in underage sex workers.

395
00:51:37,345 --> 00:51:40,264
<i>He has plenty of manpower
protecting him, of course.

396
00:51:40,348 --> 00:51:42,183
<i>But that's the least of it.

397
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:46,938
<i>There you go.

398
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:49,941
<i>The Sydney Opera House
and the Harbour Bridge.

399
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,242
<i>Cook's paranoia
is only trumped by his ego.

400
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:01,702
<i>Exhibit A. His cantilever pool.

401
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:09,126
<i>The walls and floors are all concrete,
three-feet thick.

402
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:14,799
<i>Every door is made
of six-inch nickel chromium steel.

403
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:17,468
<i>That's like 12 armor plates.

404
00:52:17,552 --> 00:52:20,263
<i>And the biometric sensors
and retina readers at the access points

405
00:52:20,346 --> 00:52:21,764
<i>are impossible to hack.

406
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:24,767
<i>It's a fortress in the sky.

407
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:57,300
Mr. Clark.
Good to meet you. Shall we?

408
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:03,806
So each apartment has over 300
square meters of premium living space.

409
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:06,726
But this one gets the Sydney sunset.

410
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:11,647
The specifications
are all in the brochure.

411
00:53:11,731 --> 00:53:14,567
Let me show you
the detailed floor plan.

412
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:18,988
We've got Italian tiles
running completely across here.

413
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:23,159
- Oh, excuse me.
- Sure.

414
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:26,120
Hello? Samantha Burns.

415
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:28,664
Hello?

416
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:35,504
Sorry about that.
So, where were we?

417
00:53:35,588 --> 00:53:37,506
You were about to tell me
about the floor plans.

418
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:38,758
Oh, yes.

419
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:26,972
But we're not dumping on the reef.

420
00:54:27,056 --> 00:54:29,225
"Near" is not on.

421
00:54:29,308 --> 00:54:32,103
And if the tree-huggers
do kick up, well, then...

422
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:34,438
Yeah. That's right.

423
00:54:34,522 --> 00:54:37,024
Now I've gotta go.
Now I've gotta go.

424
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,475
Everyone, evacuate!

425
00:58:11,739 --> 00:58:13,282
<i>Billionaire Adrian Cook

426
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:16,035
<i>plunged 76 floors
to his death this morning,

427
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:19,747
<i>when the glass pool
of his Sydney penthouse collapsed.

428
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:20,998
<i>Although authorities...

429
00:58:21,081 --> 00:58:23,083
Give him his call.

430
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:24,960
Okay.

431
00:58:25,044 --> 00:58:26,837
<i>...described his death
as a tragic accident,

432
00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:29,173
<i>effectively ruling out foul play.

433
00:58:45,481 --> 00:58:47,733
- Ready.
- Go ahead.

434
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:58,577
<i>Bishop, your watch stopped.

435
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:01,246
<i>I think it's a sign.

436
00:59:02,665 --> 00:59:04,375
Maybe it just needs cleaning.

437
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:07,670
No. Look closer.

438
00:59:11,924 --> 00:59:12,967
Son of a bitch!

439
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:33,612
<i>All right?

440
00:59:33,696 --> 00:59:35,447
This the harbor master's office?

441
00:59:35,531 --> 00:59:37,241
<i>Yeah, it is.
How may I assist you?

442
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:39,743
My name is Tom Silva.

443
00:59:39,827 --> 00:59:43,789
Some bastard in a bloody gray yacht
just scraped my vessel.

444
00:59:43,872 --> 00:59:45,666
Uh, I have the hull number,

445
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:48,460
but, uh, my insurance
needs the owner's details.

446
00:59:49,545 --> 00:59:51,797
<i>Okay, mate. Go ahead.

447
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:56,927
WRX 489-674-2239.

448
00:59:57,011 --> 00:59:59,596
<i>Okay. Give me one moment.

449
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:03,308
<i>The vessel's berth is in
Sydney Harbour on Pier 7.

450
01:00:03,392 --> 01:00:05,978
<i>That's about it.

451
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:07,855
<i>If you need any further details...

452
01:00:24,747 --> 01:00:27,458
<i>The boat
you're looking for is gone, mate.

453
01:00:28,417 --> 01:00:31,462
<i>It's a big one, too.

454
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:35,049
Head out of the harbor.
It couldn't have gone far.

455
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:37,342
<i>It's your money, boss.

456
01:00:54,276 --> 01:00:55,819
There! East!

457
01:00:58,238 --> 01:01:00,949
Come out of the sun,
so he can't see you.

458
01:01:01,617 --> 01:01:04,787
Drop it down to 60 feet
and hold it steady.

459
01:02:46,722 --> 01:02:48,724
Got it. I'm heading aft deck.

460
01:02:53,729 --> 01:02:55,647
Hey!

461
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:42,589
Take him out!

462
01:03:44,446 --> 01:03:46,156
Go.

463
01:03:58,794 --> 01:03:59,878
Go, go!

464
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:19,231
Bishop!

465
01:04:46,174 --> 01:04:50,137
You know your problem, Bishop?
You just can't help yourself.

466
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,055
That's how I knew
you'd come back for her.

467
01:04:53,473 --> 01:04:55,350
That's your weakness.

468
01:04:55,434 --> 01:04:58,186
Now do the third kill,
or the girl's dead.

469
01:05:00,022 --> 01:05:02,899
Take him down below.
And give him a proper sendoff.

470
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,470
VARNA, BULGARIA

471
01:05:58,205 --> 01:06:02,209
<i>Bishop, if you pull
another stunt like that,

472
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:06,630
<i>our deal is off, and you'll never
see your little girlfriend again.

473
01:06:10,801 --> 01:06:13,970
<i>Now playtime's over.

474
01:06:16,515 --> 01:06:21,520
<i>Go to the port town of Varna,
on the Black Sea.

475
01:06:22,938 --> 01:06:24,689
<i>That's where you'll find
your third kill.

476
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:31,863
<i>His name is Max Adams,
a wealthy American arms dealer.

477
01:06:39,287 --> 01:06:42,958
<i>On the north side of Varna,
you'll find a truly vulgar memorial

478
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:44,793
<i>to Bulgarian communism...

479
01:06:45,419 --> 01:06:47,546
<i>Adams spent a fortune restoring it

480
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:50,715
<i>and putting in the most
comprehensive security system.

481
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:02,894
<i>But the interesting part
is what you don't see.

482
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:06,731
<i>Hidden in the mountainside
below is the sub pen.

483
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:11,736
<i>Adams stocks his U-boats with
intercontinental ballistic missiles.

484
01:07:13,822 --> 01:07:18,493
<i>Nobody gets in or out.
Many have died trying.

485
01:07:18,577 --> 01:07:23,748
<i>So, needless to say, this will be
the hardest site to penetrate by far.

486
01:07:23,832 --> 01:07:27,669
<i>On top of all that, Krill and Cook's
deaths may have Adams on the defense.

487
01:07:33,341 --> 01:07:35,218
<i>You have 24 hours.

488
01:07:51,318 --> 01:07:54,237
You're using me
to take out the competition.

489
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:09,271
St. Augustino Hospital Emergency Ward.

490
01:09:11,106 --> 01:09:12,983
We will dispatch a helicopter.

491
01:10:07,621 --> 01:10:09,122
<i>Once you reach the compound,

492
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,791
<i>you'll have to deal with
several layers of security.

493
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:57,919
Zone six clear.

494
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:25,240
<i>The building has
its own power system, oxygen supply,

495
01:11:25,323 --> 01:11:27,617
<i>and a state-of-the-art panic room.

496
01:11:29,953 --> 01:11:31,454
<i>Good luck, Arthur.

497
01:11:58,648 --> 01:12:00,734
Open the goddamn door.

498
01:12:00,817 --> 01:12:02,444
Please?

499
01:12:16,124 --> 01:12:17,459
Call me when you know something.

500
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:27,343
<i>No sign of the intruder, Mr. Adams.

501
01:12:27,427 --> 01:12:29,113
That's because he's sitting
right in front of me

502
01:12:29,137 --> 01:12:31,556
here in the safe room, jackoff.

503
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:37,270
Magnificent.
Even if it is all stolen and looted.

504
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:39,272
Cubo-futurist totalitarianism.

505
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:43,651
Of course it's magnificent.
Like, uh, dinosaur bones.

506
01:12:43,735 --> 01:12:44,903
It's ugly.

507
01:12:46,738 --> 01:12:48,198
Who the fuck are you?

508
01:12:48,281 --> 01:12:49,783
I'm here to talk.

509
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:51,576
Lose your cell phone?

510
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:54,245
I should've hired
those guys from Houston.

511
01:12:54,329 --> 01:12:56,098
All right, what is it
that you want to talk about?

512
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:58,792
I want to help you avoid an accident.

513
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:01,878
Krill, Cook, that was you.

514
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:05,215
I warned those guys that one day Crain
would come after all of us.

515
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:06,800
Cappuccino? Espresso?

516
01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:08,676
Espresso. No sugar.

517
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:15,475
Krill was a warlord, but also the
number-one arms dealer in Africa.

518
01:13:15,558 --> 01:13:19,270
Cook used his mining empire as a cover
to control the Asian franchise.

519
01:13:19,354 --> 01:13:22,315
You have got Europe
and most of South America.

520
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:25,610
North America, too,
if you count Mexicans.

521
01:13:25,693 --> 01:13:27,195
That didn't leave much for Crain.

522
01:13:28,029 --> 01:13:29,823
So I have a deal for you.

523
01:13:29,906 --> 01:13:33,910
Hmm. Well, I'm a dealer.

524
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:35,370
We can talk about it.

525
01:13:43,211 --> 01:13:45,481
I've been called
a lot of ugly names over the years,

526
01:13:45,505 --> 01:13:48,508
Communist, socialist, racist, fascist...

527
01:13:48,591 --> 01:13:50,677
None of which is true, of course.

528
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:51,761
Well...

529
01:13:53,221 --> 01:13:55,181
...I'm certainly not a communist.

530
01:13:55,265 --> 01:13:57,976
You just admire
their architecture.

531
01:13:58,059 --> 01:13:59,602
I believe in fair play.

532
01:13:59,686 --> 01:14:04,315
I saw the David and Goliath story
play out on the frontlines of Vietnam.

533
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:08,152
Soviets in Afghanistan.
Ethnic cleansing in Bosnia.

534
01:14:08,236 --> 01:14:10,071
Chemical weapons on the Kurds.

535
01:14:10,154 --> 01:14:13,241
The little guy is always
gonna need a slingshot,

536
01:14:13,324 --> 01:14:15,451
and somebody's always gonna pay for it.

537
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:18,872
An arms dealer with a moral clause.

538
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:20,206
Mmm-hmm.

539
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:24,711
Let's talk about Crain.
We both need him gone.

540
01:14:24,794 --> 01:14:28,131
The question is, how do we accomplish
that? He's got an army around him.

541
01:14:28,214 --> 01:14:31,759
We need something tempting enough so
that Crain uses his men to go after it.

542
01:14:32,802 --> 01:14:36,890
- What do you have in mind?
- Your submarine pen.

543
01:14:36,973 --> 01:14:40,768
Have them search
for weapons, treasure...

544
01:14:40,852 --> 01:14:42,020
Your corpse.

545
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:43,980
What?

546
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:47,066
You'll have to die.

547
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:48,860
Well, that's easy.

548
01:14:48,943 --> 01:14:50,987
Although it will cost
a tremendous amount of money.

549
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:53,656
You can afford it.

550
01:15:06,461 --> 01:15:07,921
Are the boats all secured?

551
01:15:08,004 --> 01:15:09,631
Yes, sir.

552
01:15:09,714 --> 01:15:11,609
- Batteries charged?
- Yes, sir.

553
01:15:11,633 --> 01:15:13,843
- Fully provisioned?
- Yes, sir.

554
01:15:13,927 --> 01:15:15,988
You get those Russian girls
in here last night for the crew?

555
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:17,055
Yes, sir.

556
01:15:17,138 --> 01:15:19,349
Well, looks like we're ready to go.

557
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:28,816
Stay here.

558
01:15:59,514 --> 01:16:02,350
<i>There was an explosion,
and Mr. Adams fell into the water.

559
01:16:02,433 --> 01:16:06,270
<i>His security, they tried to reach him,
but the rocks came down,

560
01:16:06,354 --> 01:16:09,565
<i>and he was buried under the water.
Gone.

561
01:16:15,405 --> 01:16:17,115
Oh, my God.

562
01:16:18,658 --> 01:16:23,663
I never imagined that dying would be
so goddamn invigorating.

563
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:25,456
Stay out of sight for two days.

564
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:27,875
After that, you can
invigorate all you want.

565
01:16:51,065 --> 01:16:53,276
You calling for the driver?

566
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:55,611
Making dinner reservations?

567
01:16:55,695 --> 01:16:57,321
Checking in with Mom?

568
01:16:57,405 --> 01:16:59,407
I'm calling Crain
to make sure he takes the bait.

569
01:17:07,582 --> 01:17:10,043
You do know how to put on a show.

570
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:11,794
There's a pier
a few miles north of Varna.

571
01:17:11,878 --> 01:17:14,047
Be there tomorrow with the girl.

572
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:16,257
Not until I see Adams' body.

573
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:19,677
You'll find him
with his most prized possessions.

574
01:17:19,761 --> 01:17:21,304
<i>In his submarine pen.

575
01:17:28,603 --> 01:17:31,981
Get over there. Find Adams' body.

576
01:17:32,065 --> 01:17:34,692
Secure everything inside the pen.

577
01:17:34,776 --> 01:17:37,028
And, uh, what about Bishop?

578
01:17:37,987 --> 01:17:39,280
Kill him.

579
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:55,690
Jeremy, point the camera
forward, so I can see.

580
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:16,794
All right. Let's go. Fan out.

581
01:19:33,519 --> 01:19:34,854
Where the hell is Bishop?

582
01:19:38,232 --> 01:19:40,318
Sir, it's clear.

583
01:19:40,401 --> 01:19:41,652
2-1 clear.

584
01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:49,285
- Contact right rear.
- Take cover!

585
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:01,047
Take cover! Take cover!

586
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:32,578
Go, go, go!

587
01:20:58,354 --> 01:20:59,939
Motherfucker!

588
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:17,039
Anything?

589
01:21:17,123 --> 01:21:19,292
No sign of him, Mr. Crain.

590
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:24,839
Stay sharp. Bishop's coming.
You can count on it.

591
01:21:30,803 --> 01:21:33,472
- What's going on?
- Your boyfriend's coming to die.

592
01:21:34,598 --> 01:21:37,476
And you're the bait. Move!

593
01:22:07,882 --> 01:22:09,383
Come on, Bishop.

594
01:22:11,302 --> 01:22:13,095
I know you're not going to let her die.

595
01:22:21,812 --> 01:22:23,064
Nothing here.

596
01:22:31,405 --> 01:22:32,782
Yeah, we're clear.

597
01:22:55,429 --> 01:22:56,639
Bring her to the bridge.

598
01:23:11,904 --> 01:23:13,030
Let's move.

599
01:26:08,998 --> 01:26:11,834
Let's go. We have three minutes
before it blows.

600
01:26:21,677 --> 01:26:23,554
Gina. You okay?

601
01:26:24,471 --> 01:26:25,556
I'll be fine.

602
01:26:28,309 --> 01:26:31,562
Let me see. Oh, shit.

603
01:26:31,645 --> 01:26:33,606
I saw Crain doing something
on the console.

604
01:26:36,483 --> 01:26:37,526
What's going on?

605
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:39,278
Crain is trying to kill us.

606
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:41,155
Let's go.

607
01:26:41,989 --> 01:26:43,574
Move this shit on the boat, now!

608
01:26:43,657 --> 01:26:45,075
Yes, sir.

609
01:26:47,286 --> 01:26:49,204
- What is this?
- Just get in.

610
01:26:51,248 --> 01:26:53,083
Wait. What are you doing?

611
01:26:53,167 --> 01:26:54,460
Making sure you live.

612
01:26:54,543 --> 01:26:57,630
No! Come with me! Bishop!

613
01:26:58,881 --> 01:27:00,633
- There he is!
- Bishop!

614
01:27:08,557 --> 01:27:09,850
Find him. Now!

615
01:27:09,933 --> 01:27:11,685
- Move!
- Fletcher!

616
01:27:12,603 --> 01:27:14,146
Let's get going.

617
01:28:28,095 --> 01:28:29,805
You never asked why.

618
01:28:29,888 --> 01:28:31,724
I know why.

619
01:28:31,807 --> 01:28:33,684
'Cause I got out, and you didn't.

620
01:28:34,685 --> 01:28:36,186
And here we are again.

621
01:28:36,270 --> 01:28:40,232
You deserted me.
It's time you paid for that.

622
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:41,692
No chance.

623
01:28:43,277 --> 01:28:44,820
You're gonna get your third kill.

624
01:28:46,947 --> 01:28:49,700
But this one won't look like
an accident.

625
01:29:41,627 --> 01:29:43,879
You're a dead man, Bishop.

626
01:29:47,466 --> 01:29:50,511
You might get off the boat,
but you'll never swim far enough away

627
01:29:50,594 --> 01:29:51,762
before she blows.

628
01:29:52,763 --> 01:29:54,223
Who said I was swimming?

629
01:30:01,021 --> 01:30:02,397
Bishop!

630
01:30:06,235 --> 01:30:07,903
Bishop!

631
01:30:10,823 --> 01:30:12,491
Bishop!

632
01:30:38,559 --> 01:30:39,852
Hey!

633
01:30:41,311 --> 01:30:42,729
Hey!

634
01:31:07,421 --> 01:31:09,464
Were there any survivors?

635
01:31:11,174 --> 01:31:12,467
No.

636
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:27,753
That's the anchor compartment.
Nothing more out there.

637
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:29,902
So Bishop never made it.

638
01:31:29,985 --> 01:31:31,653
Even legends die.

639
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,629
PHNOM PENH, CAMBODIA

640
01:31:52,925 --> 01:31:57,262
<i>Dear Mei. I'm back
in Cambodia with the kids.

641
01:31:57,346 --> 01:31:59,348
<i>The water filter's working.

642
01:31:59,431 --> 01:32:02,100
<i>Thank you so much
for your generous gift.

643
01:32:02,184 --> 01:32:04,019
<i>You have to come here someday.

644
01:32:04,102 --> 01:32:07,105
<i>I think you'd like it a lot.

645
01:32:07,189 --> 01:32:12,027
<i>Bishop would have loved it.
See you soon. I hope.

646
01:32:12,110 --> 01:32:15,072
<i>Lots of love, Gina.

647
01:33:44,536 --> 01:33:45,787
Clever son of a bitch.

648
01:34:05,390 --> 01:34:07,142
Sneaky bastard.

649
01:34:07,225 --> 01:34:11,146
Bang. You're dead.
