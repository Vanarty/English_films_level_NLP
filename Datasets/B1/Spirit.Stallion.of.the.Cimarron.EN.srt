1
00:00:36,883 --> 00:00:46,554
''Spirit Stallion of the Cimarron''

2
00:01:44,384 --> 00:01:47,615
The story I want to tell you,
can not be found in a book.

3
00:01:48,155 --> 00:01:51,886
They say the history of the West was
written from the saddle of a horse.

4
00:01:52,692 --> 00:01:54,853
But it's never been told
from the heart of one.

5
00:01:55,996 --> 00:01:57,327
Not until now.

6
00:01:59,332 --> 00:02:00,993
I was born here.

7
00:02:01,168 --> 00:02:04,103
In this place that would come
to be called the ''Old West''

8
00:02:04,738 --> 00:02:09,368
But to my kind, the land was ageless.
It had no beginning and no end.

9
00:02:10,043 --> 00:02:12,637
No boundary between earth and sky.

10
00:02:14,014 --> 00:02:17,711
Like the wind in the Buffalo grass.
We belong here.

11
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,242
We will always belong here.

12
00:02:23,723 --> 00:02:26,089
They say the mustang is the
spirit of the West.

13
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:29,059
Whether that West
was won or lost in the end

14
00:02:29,429 --> 00:02:30,953
You have to decide for yourself.

15
00:02:31,431 --> 00:02:34,628
But the story
I want to tell you is true.

16
00:02:35,502 --> 00:02:36,730
I was there.

17
00:02:37,504 --> 00:02:38,994
And I remember.

18
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,105
I remember the sun, and the sky
and the wind calling my name.

19
00:02:43,743 --> 00:02:46,109
In the time when the wild
horses ran free.

20
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:36,449
## Here I am

21
00:04:37,557 --> 00:04:39,218
## This is me

22
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,397
## I come to this world so wild and free

23
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:47,560
## Here I am

24
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:50,669
## So young and strong

25
00:04:51,171 --> 00:04:55,232
## Right here in the place where I belong

26
00:04:56,343 --> 00:04:58,709
## It's a new world

27
00:04:59,012 --> 00:05:01,378
## It's a new start

28
00:05:01,848 --> 00:05:06,808
## It's life with a beating of
## a young heart

29
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,579
## It's a new day

30
00:05:10,357 --> 00:05:12,518
## In a new land

31
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:15,489
## And it's waiting for me

32
00:05:17,497 --> 00:05:19,727
## Here I am

33
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:26,027
## It's a new world

34
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:28,839
## It's a new start

35
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:34,039
## It's life with a beating of
## a young heart

36
00:05:34,547 --> 00:05:37,038
## Yeah, it's a new day

37
00:05:37,617 --> 00:05:39,778
## In a new land

38
00:05:40,253 --> 00:05:43,051
## And it's waiting for me

39
00:05:44,724 --> 00:05:47,124
## Here I am

40
00:07:30,697 --> 00:07:33,325
And so I grew from colt to stallion

41
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,627
As wild and reckless

42
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:36,362
As thunder over the land.

43
00:07:36,636 --> 00:07:38,194
Racing with the eagle.

44
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:39,670
Soaring with the wind.

45
00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:43,140
Flying? 
There were times I believed I could.

46
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,269
Like my father before me

47
00:08:16,342 --> 00:08:20,278
I became leader of the Cimarron herd.
And with that honour

48
00:08:20,346 --> 00:08:22,075
Came responsibility.

49
00:09:27,981 --> 00:09:30,950
## I hear the wind

50
00:09:31,751 --> 00:09:34,515
## Across the plane

51
00:09:35,288 --> 00:09:38,348
## A sound so strong

52
00:09:38,992 --> 00:09:42,155
## That calls my name 

53
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:45,764
## It's wild like the river

54
00:09:46,432 --> 00:09:49,094
## It's warm like the sun

55
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:51,327
## Yeah, it's here

56
00:09:51,771 --> 00:09:55,366
## This is where I belong

57
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,836
## Under the star skies

58
00:10:01,214 --> 00:10:04,274
## Where eagles have flown

59
00:10:05,218 --> 00:10:08,119
## This place is paradise

60
00:10:08,554 --> 00:10:12,217
## It's the place I call home

61
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:15,551
## The moon on the mountain

62
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:19,164
## The whisper through the trees

63
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:22,333
## The winds on the water

64
00:10:22,502 --> 00:10:26,302
## Let nothing come between this and me

65
00:10:26,739 --> 00:10:29,970
## It's everything I want

66
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,811
## It's everything this here

67
00:10:34,647 --> 00:10:37,707
## And when we are all together

68
00:10:38,384 --> 00:10:40,545
## There's nothing

69
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,184
## To fear

70
00:11:00,406 --> 00:11:03,773
## And wherever I wander

71
00:11:04,344 --> 00:11:07,711
## The one thing I've learned 

72
00:11:08,948 --> 00:11:10,438
## Yes

73
00:11:11,284 --> 00:11:12,774
## It's to here

74
00:11:13,252 --> 00:11:15,413
## I will always

75
00:11:15,888 --> 00:11:19,346
## Always

76
00:11:21,394 --> 00:11:23,294
## Return

77
00:12:04,504 --> 00:12:06,802
Something new came upon
the land one night.

78
00:12:07,473 --> 00:12:09,737
Something that changed my life 
forever...

79
00:12:10,676 --> 00:12:13,543
And so my journey began.

80
00:13:11,337 --> 00:13:13,498
A wiser horse might have turned
and ran.

81
00:13:14,674 --> 00:13:17,040
But I wanted to know what
strange creature was here.

82
00:13:54,514 --> 00:13:55,538
Look.

83
00:13:57,817 --> 00:14:00,752
Man, look at that stallion, 
it is beautiful.

84
00:14:36,489 --> 00:14:37,820
Follow the horse! Let's go!

85
00:16:37,543 --> 00:16:38,703
Look out!

86
00:17:02,335 --> 00:17:03,700
Don't you get away!

87
00:18:05,398 --> 00:18:06,763
I was scared.

88
00:18:06,832 --> 00:18:08,732
I didn't know what was going
to happen to me.

89
00:18:09,735 --> 00:18:12,599
At least my mother
and the herd were safe.

90
00:18:16,242 --> 00:18:17,732
Come on! 

91
00:18:21,347 --> 00:18:23,577
## I got find another fight

92
00:18:24,283 --> 00:18:26,444
## I got run another night

93
00:18:27,353 --> 00:18:29,514
## Get it out, check it out

94
00:18:30,222 --> 00:18:33,055
## I'm on my way and I don't feel right

95
00:18:33,426 --> 00:18:35,553
## I got come back

96
00:18:35,928 --> 00:18:38,453
## I can't be beat, and that's a fact

97
00:18:39,365 --> 00:18:41,560
## It's Ok, I'll find a way

98
00:18:41,901 --> 00:18:45,064
## Ain't gonna take me, down the way

99
00:18:46,105 --> 00:18:47,572
## Yeah

100
00:18:48,274 --> 00:18:51,107
## Don't judge a thing 'till you know 
## what is inside it

101
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,571
## Don't push me, I'll fight it

102
00:18:53,946 --> 00:18:57,279
## Never gonna give it up, no

103
00:18:59,652 --> 00:19:02,985
## If you can't catch a wave
## Then you'll never gonna ride it

104
00:19:03,255 --> 00:19:05,815
## You can't come uninvited

105
00:19:05,991 --> 00:19:11,324
## Never gonna give it up, no

106
00:19:11,991 --> 00:19:13,924
## You can't take me

107
00:19:14,264 --> 00:19:16,166
## I'm free

108
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:29,474
## Why did it all go wrong

109
00:19:30,249 --> 00:19:32,513
## I wanna know what's going on

110
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:35,583
## What's this holding me?

111
00:19:36,288 --> 00:19:38,916
## I'm not where I'm supposed to be

112
00:19:39,325 --> 00:19:41,418
## I got fight another fight

113
00:19:42,261 --> 00:19:44,456
## I got fight with all my might

114
00:19:45,197 --> 00:19:47,495
## I'm getting out, just check it out

115
00:19:48,267 --> 00:19:51,031
## You're in my way,
## You better watch out

116
00:19:51,203 --> 00:19:52,534
Open the gate!

117
00:19:53,305 --> 00:19:57,002
Come on!
## Don't judge a thing 'till you know
## what's inside it

118
00:19:57,376 --> 00:19:59,776
## Don't push me, I'll fight it

119
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:03,380
## Never gonna give it up, no

120
00:20:05,718 --> 00:20:08,881
## If you can't catch a wave
## Then you'll never gonna ride it

121
00:20:09,188 --> 00:20:11,782
## You can't come uninvited

122
00:20:12,024 --> 00:20:15,551
## Never gonna give it up, no

123
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:22,166
## You can't take me
## I'm free

124
00:20:25,838 --> 00:20:27,635
## Yeah, I'm free

125
00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:42,250
What seems to be the
problem, gentlemen?

126
00:20:42,488 --> 00:20:43,978
We got this crazy one here, Sir.

127
00:20:44,423 --> 00:20:45,289
- Pure Mustang, Colonel.

128
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,087
Really?

129
00:20:50,896 --> 00:20:53,057
The army has dealt with
wild horses before.

130
00:20:53,832 --> 00:20:55,390
This one will be no different.

131
00:20:59,972 --> 00:21:00,996
I remember the first time

132
00:21:01,073 --> 00:21:03,407
I saw a rattler curled up in my path

133
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,317
-Induct this animal, Sargent.
-Yes Sir!

134
00:21:07,344 --> 00:21:09,436
This one didn't look like a rattler.

135
00:21:09,481 --> 00:21:12,143
But I was still thinking...
snake.

136
00:21:13,354 --> 00:21:15,048
Grab him, grab him.

137
00:21:19,258 --> 00:21:21,123
Okay Murphy, he's all yours.

138
00:21:22,261 --> 00:21:23,523
He's a wild one.

139
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,395
We'll see how wild he is,
when I am done with him.

140
00:21:35,374 --> 00:21:36,841
You want a fight, do you?

141
00:21:48,153 --> 00:21:49,085
Right.

142
00:22:13,946 --> 00:22:15,243
Make sure that's good tight.

143
00:22:22,287 --> 00:22:23,811
Murphy, look out! Watch out!

144
00:23:01,194 --> 00:23:03,354
Murphy, are you okay?

145
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:11,099
Corporal, round up some volunteers to
take this animal to the stables.

146
00:23:11,403 --> 00:23:15,362
Not the stables. -Sir? 
-The corral.

147
00:23:16,141 --> 00:23:17,301
It's time to break that horse.

148
00:23:21,914 --> 00:23:27,045
# Well you think that you can take me on
# You must be crazy

149
00:23:27,386 --> 00:23:29,047
Make sure it's good tied.

150
00:23:30,189 --> 00:23:35,183
## Ain't a single thing you've done
## Is gonna phase me

151
00:23:37,563 --> 00:23:40,555
## If you wanna have a go

152
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,434
# I just wanna let you know

153
00:23:46,171 --> 00:23:50,403
## Get off my back and into my game

154
00:23:50,576 --> 00:23:54,171
## Get out of my way
## Cause I'm wild and untamed

155
00:23:54,513 --> 00:23:58,244
## Get out of my face
## Or gimme your best shot

156
00:23:59,451 --> 00:24:02,045
## I think it's time 
## You better face the fact

157
00:24:02,287 --> 00:24:04,380
## Get off my back

158
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,282
Ok, my turn!

159
00:24:12,131 --> 00:24:17,125
## You know is all just a game
## that I'm playing

160
00:24:20,105 --> 00:24:25,133
## You think that you can find a
## way in, is what I'm saying

161
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,544
## If you wanna have a go

162
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:34,746
## I just wanna let you know

163
00:24:36,255 --> 00:24:40,316
## Get off my back and
## into my game

164
00:24:40,793 --> 00:24:44,388
## Get out of my face
## Cause I'm wild and untamed

165
00:24:44,663 --> 00:24:48,258
## Get out of my way
## Or gimme your best shot

166
00:24:48,467 --> 00:24:49,593
Another rider!

167
00:24:49,768 --> 00:24:54,262
## You know the train is coming off its track
## Get off my back

168
00:24:55,841 --> 00:24:58,332
## Yeah, get off my back

169
00:24:59,845 --> 00:25:01,278
## Get off

170
00:25:05,184 --> 00:25:08,017
## Get off, get off, get off

171
00:25:12,024 --> 00:25:14,254
## Get off my back

172
00:25:19,665 --> 00:25:23,123
Sargent. -Yes Sir.
Tie this horse to the post.

173
00:25:23,869 --> 00:25:26,599
No food or water. Three days.

174
00:25:26,772 --> 00:25:27,500
Yes Sir.

175
00:26:23,795 --> 00:26:26,491
My heart galloped through
the sky that night

176
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:29,094
Back to my herd.

177
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:30,696
Where I belonged.

178
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,797
And I wonder if they'd miss me

179
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:36,373
As much as I miss them.

180
00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:31,418
We got a hostile!

181
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:39,796
Bring him there this way.

182
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:46,770
Well, what do we have here?

183
00:27:48,547 --> 00:27:50,344
We caught him
by the supply wagon, Sir.

184
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:54,341
Ah, a Dakota.

185
00:27:55,258 --> 00:27:58,470
Not as tall as the Cheyenne,
and fine featured as the Crow.

186
00:27:59,391 --> 00:28:01,552
Take him away gentlemen,
show him our best.

187
00:28:01,894 --> 00:28:03,758
Corporal, take him to the stock case.

188
00:28:03,829 --> 00:28:06,626
Not the stock case. The post.

189
00:28:07,566 --> 00:28:08,464
No food or water.

190
00:28:17,809 --> 00:28:19,299
What are you looking at boy?

191
00:28:21,446 --> 00:28:23,277
He was called Little Creak.

192
00:28:23,515 --> 00:28:25,210
And he seemed different from the rest.

193
00:29:20,605 --> 00:29:23,904
There were just no end to the 
strange ways of the two legged.

194
00:29:43,395 --> 00:29:47,388
With the Colonel permission, Sir. 
Incoming patrol report hostiles 
headed North.

195
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:49,733
The railroad has expressed concern, Sir.

196
00:29:50,035 --> 00:29:51,969
They requested additional patrols.

197
00:29:52,904 --> 00:29:53,836
How long has it been, Sargent?

198
00:29:53,905 --> 00:29:56,396
Sir?
-The mustang.

199
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:58,365
How long has it been tied?

200
00:29:58,777 --> 00:30:00,005
Three days, Sir.

201
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:01,441
Good.

202
00:30:01,813 --> 00:30:03,474
Fetch my crop and spurs.

203
00:30:23,368 --> 00:30:24,460
Take it easy!

204
00:30:27,372 --> 00:30:28,464
Back up! Back up!

205
00:31:25,897 --> 00:31:29,128
You see gentlemen,
any horse can be broken.

206
00:31:32,804 --> 00:31:33,862
Move along mustang.

207
00:31:37,742 --> 00:31:41,143
There are those in Washington who believe
the West will never be settled.

208
00:31:43,048 --> 00:31:46,074
The northern pacific railroad 
will never breach Nebraska.

209
00:31:50,088 --> 00:31:54,525
A hostile Dakota will never 
submit to providence.

210
00:31:57,762 --> 00:32:00,094
And it is that manner of small thinking.

211
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:02,999
That would say this horse 
could never be broken.

212
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:07,568
Discipline, time, and patience.

213
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,874
Are the three great levelers.

214
00:32:16,181 --> 00:32:19,014
Sometimes a horse's gotta do,
what a horse's gotta do

215
00:32:20,051 --> 00:32:22,042
And this was one of those times.

216
00:32:59,724 --> 00:33:00,850
Get off me!

217
00:33:26,351 --> 00:33:29,252
Soldier! Secure that horse!

218
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,181
I wasn't sure
what happened back there.

219
00:34:38,323 --> 00:34:40,587
And I wasn't about to stop and ask.

220
00:34:40,925 --> 00:34:43,553
All I knew was I was headed home.

221
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,787
I couldn't believe it.

222
00:35:10,221 --> 00:35:14,282
One moment I was free,
and the next... more ropes.

223
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,478
I couldn't understand it.

224
00:37:49,948 --> 00:37:51,916
She treated the scrawny two-legged

225
00:37:51,983 --> 00:37:53,314
Like one of our kind.

226
00:37:53,518 --> 00:37:54,507
Prancing around him

227
00:37:54,586 --> 00:37:56,281
Like a love struck ear ring.

228
00:37:57,522 --> 00:37:59,353
It was down right unnatural.

229
00:38:07,066 --> 00:38:11,232
Great mustang, today I will ride you.

230
00:38:13,835 --> 00:38:15,545
This ought to be good...

231
00:38:40,531 --> 00:38:41,896
Mares.

232
00:38:48,139 --> 00:38:50,403
Okay, Rain, lets see if you can teach

233
00:38:50,475 --> 00:38:51,999
This mustang some manners.

234
00:40:08,019 --> 00:40:09,145
Okay, I admit it

235
00:40:09,353 --> 00:40:10,547
She was charming

236
00:40:11,122 --> 00:40:13,522
In a stubborn, irritating kind of way.

237
00:40:14,092 --> 00:40:16,185
So, I let her show me her world.

238
00:41:39,076 --> 00:41:40,737
Bye-Bye horsey.

239
00:43:40,562 --> 00:43:42,223
For the first time in my life,

240
00:43:42,831 --> 00:43:45,299
I felt my heart torn two ways.

241
00:43:54,775 --> 00:43:56,141
Give it back!

242
00:43:56,812 --> 00:43:57,540
Mustang!

243
00:44:50,499 --> 00:44:52,330
I had to hand to that boy.

244
00:44:52,835 --> 00:44:54,564
He just wouldn't give up.

245
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,351
I'm never gonna ride you, am I?

246
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:49,584
And no one never should.

247
00:46:16,418 --> 00:46:17,680
You can go.

248
00:46:23,459 --> 00:46:24,426
It's okay, go.

249
00:46:31,733 --> 00:46:33,257
Go on, get out of here.

250
00:46:35,037 --> 00:46:36,265
Go home.

251
00:47:41,737 --> 00:47:44,570
I knew this was hard for her,
and she was scared.

252
00:47:45,607 --> 00:47:49,941
But more than anything,
I wanted to share my homeland with her

253
00:51:44,746 --> 00:51:46,611
I laid beside her that night.

254
00:51:47,182 --> 00:51:51,778
Hoping, praying that somehow
she would be okay.

255
00:51:56,324 --> 00:51:57,882
There are a couple
of horses over there!

256
00:52:23,952 --> 00:52:24,884
Leave her there.

257
00:52:24,953 --> 00:52:26,614
She's not gonna make it.

258
00:52:59,178 --> 00:52:59,804
Oh, Rain!

259
00:53:03,183 --> 00:53:04,392
Easy, girl. 

260
00:53:04,851 --> 00:53:06,561
Easy.

261
00:53:09,022 --> 00:53:10,232
It will be okay. 

262
00:53:24,246 --> 00:53:25,804
You saved my life.

263
00:53:54,567 --> 00:53:55,860
I'm not gonna hurt you.

264
00:53:56,177 --> 00:53:58,441
Come on, it's gonna be okay.

265
00:54:19,603 --> 00:54:21,628
## Sound the bugle now

266
00:54:24,241 --> 00:54:26,004
## Play it just for me

267
00:54:29,012 --> 00:54:31,173
## As the seasons change

268
00:54:31,448 --> 00:54:34,611
## Remember how I used to be

269
00:54:36,853 --> 00:54:38,821
## Now I can't go on

270
00:54:41,158 --> 00:54:42,989
## I can't even start

271
00:54:45,929 --> 00:54:47,920
## I got nothing left

272
00:54:48,332 --> 00:54:50,994
## Just an empty heart

273
00:54:54,204 --> 00:54:56,195
## I'm a soldier

274
00:54:56,873 --> 00:55:00,809
## Wounded soul I must give up the fight

275
00:55:01,979 --> 00:55:05,210
## There's nothing more for me

276
00:55:06,283 --> 00:55:08,274
## Lead me away

277
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:15,520
## Or leave me lying here

278
00:55:31,408 --> 00:55:33,706
## Sound the bugle now

279
00:55:35,912 --> 00:55:37,846
## Tell them I don't care

280
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:42,415
## There's not a road I know

281
00:55:42,853 --> 00:55:45,549
## That leads to anywhere

282
00:55:48,392 --> 00:55:50,917
## Without a light

283
00:55:51,495 --> 00:55:55,329
## I fear that I'll stumble in the dark

284
00:55:56,767 --> 00:56:00,760
## Lay out down
## Decide

285
00:56:00,937 --> 00:56:03,428
## Not to go on

286
00:56:04,941 --> 00:56:07,239
## That from high

287
00:56:08,278 --> 00:56:11,577
## Somewhere in the distance

288
00:56:13,917 --> 00:56:16,249
## There's a voice that calls

289
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:19,182
## Remember who you are

290
00:56:22,292 --> 00:56:25,693
## If you loose yourself

291
00:56:27,097 --> 00:56:30,032
## Your courage soon will follow

292
00:56:30,701 --> 00:56:33,465
## So, be strong tonight

293
00:56:37,641 --> 00:56:40,041
## Remember who you are

294
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:55,251
## Yeah

295
00:56:56,093 --> 00:56:59,426
## You're a soldier now

296
00:57:00,831 --> 00:57:03,732
## Fighting in a battle

297
00:57:04,568 --> 00:57:07,469
## To be free once more

298
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:13,471
## Yeah, that's worth fighting for

299
00:57:22,383 --> 00:57:24,044
It'll be alright.

300
00:57:51,146 --> 00:57:52,977
I didn't know
why we were brought here.

301
00:57:53,615 --> 00:57:54,946
What I did know

302
00:57:55,183 --> 00:57:59,276
was we had to find a way to escape,
and get back home.

303
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:09,690
Well, that is it, we're rolling 
the steam over the mountain.

304
00:58:10,265 --> 00:58:12,392
We got six days to connect to Utah.

305
00:58:13,568 --> 00:58:15,058
Move out and gone.

306
00:58:47,027 --> 00:58:48,528
Ready to go!

307
00:59:36,535 --> 00:59:39,996
We're almost on the top!

308
00:59:59,774 --> 01:00:02,106
That was the moment I understood

309
01:00:02,477 --> 01:00:04,240
They were headed to my homeland

310
01:00:04,312 --> 01:00:05,836
And I had to stop them.

311
01:00:09,652 --> 01:00:11,736
Get back!

312
01:00:13,863 --> 01:00:16,240
Oh, we got to stop!

313
01:00:22,231 --> 01:00:23,198
Hold it!

314
01:00:30,972 --> 01:00:32,599
Get the mules up here!

315
01:04:45,626 --> 01:04:46,854
I don't know where he came from

316
01:04:46,928 --> 01:04:48,122
Or how he got there.

317
01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:50,659
But I sure was happy to see him.

318
01:05:57,198 --> 01:05:58,062
I don't believe it.

319
01:05:59,934 --> 01:06:01,094
Go! Go! Run!

320
01:08:08,295 --> 01:08:09,125
We got 'em now!

321
01:08:11,167--> 01:08:12,490
Where did they go?

322
01:08:13,501 --> 01:08:15,338
There they are!
Up there!

323
01:08:40,227 --> 01:08:41,216
Oh no.

324
01:08:44,732 --> 01:08:46,097
Oh yes.

325
01:10:20,563 --> 01:10:23,555
## Don't judge a thing 'till you know
## what is inside it

326
01:10:23,733 --> 01:10:25,792
## Don't push me, I'll fight it

327
01:10:26,135 --> 01:10:29,468
## Never gonna give it up, no

328
01:10:31,641 --> 01:10:34,804
## If you can't catch a wave
## Then you'll never gonna ride it

329
01:10:35,144 --> 01:10:37,578
## You can't come uninvited

330
01:10:37,747 --> 01:10:41,205
## Never gonna give it up, no!

331
01:10:43,719 --> 01:10:47,655
## You can't take me
## I'm free

332
01:12:34,094 --> 01:12:36,221
You will always be in my heart.

333
01:12:51,578 --> 01:12:54,945
Take care of her,
Spirit...

334
01:12:55,916 --> 01:12:57,474
Who cannot be broken.

335
01:13:17,438 --> 01:13:19,303
I will miss you, my friend.

336
01:13:37,391 --> 01:13:39,518
I've been waiting
so long to run free.

337
01:13:40,594 --> 01:13:43,563
But that goodbye was harder
than I ever imagined.

338
01:13:45,099 --> 01:13:46,896
I will never forget that boy.

339
01:13:48,068 --> 01:13:50,434
And how we won back
our freedom together.

340
01:13:57,780 --> 01:14:01,045
## I hear the wind

341
01:14:01,684 --> 01:14:04,744
## Call my name

342
01:14:05,588 --> 01:14:08,352
## The sound that leads me

343
01:14:08,958 --> 01:14:12,052
## Home again

344
01:14:12,928 --> 01:14:15,726
## It sparks up the fire

345
01:14:16,465 --> 01:14:19,866
## A flame that still runs

346
01:14:20,236 --> 01:14:21,567
## To you

347
01:14:21,804 --> 01:14:25,069
## I will always return

348
01:14:27,209 --> 01:14:30,542
## I know the road is long

349
01:14:30,813 --> 01:14:34,476
## But where you are is home

350
01:14:35,317 --> 01:14:37,979
## Wherever you stay

351
01:14:38,988 --> 01:14:41,752
## I'll find the way

352
01:14:42,792 --> 01:14:46,057
## I run like the river

353
01:14:46,462 --> 01:14:49,488
## I'll follow the sun

354
01:14:50,266 --> 01:14:53,497
## I'll fly like an eagle

355
01:14:54,069 --> 01:14:57,505
## To where I belong

356
01:14:57,940 --> 01:15:01,068
## I can't stand the distance

357
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:04,775
## I can't dream alone

358
01:15:05,347 --> 01:15:08,339
## I can't wait to see you

359
01:15:08,918 --> 01:15:12,285
## Yes, I'm on my way home

360
01:15:12,588 --> 01:15:15,751
## Now I know it's true

361
01:15:16,025 --> 01:15:19,358
## That every road leads to you

362
01:15:20,362 --> 01:15:23,627
## And in the hour of darkness

363
01:15:23,866 --> 01:15:27,802
## Your light gets me through

364
01:15:29,638 --> 01:15:32,698
## You run like the river

365
01:15:33,475 --> 01:15:36,205
## You shine like the sun

366
01:15:37,446 --> 01:15:38,606
## Yeah

367
01:15:38,981 --> 01:15:42,212
## You fly like an eagle

368
01:15:42,718 --> 01:15:46,154
## Yeah, you are the one

369
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:51,689
## I've seen every sunset

370
01:15:52,061 --> 01:15:55,553
## And with all that I've learned

371
01:15:59,368 --> 01:16:02,997
## It's to you I will always

372
01:16:03,739 --> 01:16:06,401
## Always

373
01:16:08,077 --> 01:16:09,874
## Return

374
01:16:10,713 --> 01:16:13,443
