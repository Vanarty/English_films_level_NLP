1
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:29,697
Here's something
that should hurt your brain.

2
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:33,367
We can empty
half of all the beds

3
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:35,603
in all the hospitals
in the world

4
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:38,372
by just giving people
clean water.

5
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:51,852
So have you ever heard
of Dean Kamen?

6
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,121
No.

7
00:00:53,154 --> 00:00:54,555
No?
No.

8
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:55,756
Uh, I don't think so.

9
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,125
I have not heard of
Dean Kamen.

10
00:00:57,158 --> 00:00:58,302
I've heard of
the Cayman Islands,

11
00:00:58,326 --> 00:00:59,527
but not Dean Kamen.
Okay.

12
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,862
Do you know what a
Segway is? Of course.

13
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,932
Yes, I know what those are.
Little trolleys?

14
00:01:04,965 --> 00:01:07,535
The little things you ride with
two wheels? Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

15
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,770
So Dean Kamen's the guy
that invented the Segway.

16
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,239
Oh, really?
Yeah.

17
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:14,074
Oh, wait. Is that the dude that,
like, drove a Segway off the cliff?

18
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:16,710
He's... He's dead, isn't he?

19
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:20,448
Didn't he
fall off one and die?

20
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:22,983
A lot of people think the
inventor of the Segway is dead.

21
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:26,154
But they don't really know
who invented the Segway.

22
00:01:26,187 --> 00:01:28,589
This rumor
has been out that

23
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:33,127
the Segway guy has died.

24
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:40,468
One of the people that
hears this story is my mother.

25
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:45,606
So she, of course, calls my
cell phone and gets no answer.

26
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:47,941
There are so many messages.

27
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:51,579
I call my mother and say,
"Mother, what's wrong?"

28
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:54,648
"Now that I'm talking to you,
nothing!"

29
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:59,353
Oh, did that really work?

30
00:01:59,387 --> 00:02:01,689
So what is that thing
actually for?

31
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:04,124
All you're really
trying to do is

32
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:06,494
see something
and hear something

33
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:08,496
that you knew to be
contemporaneous.

34
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:10,489
I was just trying to make
some noise to confuse...

35
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:14,644
Oh, but that should have information
about where in the system it is.

36
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:16,870
It also has the take
and it has the numbers...

37
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:18,472
Okay, come back, come back!

38
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:29,783
I must admit,
I do like technology.

39
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:33,754
I like machines and I like
the efficiency they deliver.

40
00:02:34,422 --> 00:02:35,823
I'm guilty.

41
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:39,193
From a very early age,
I both wanted to know

42
00:02:39,227 --> 00:02:44,232
more and more about the rules by
which this universe of ours operates.

43
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,068
And, through the
world of engineering,

44
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,671
I wanted to start
applying those rules

45
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:55,309
to create inventions that would
give people a better quality of life,

46
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:57,345
if those inventions work.

47
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:02,583
Most kids, when they grow up,
develop what's called good judgment.

48
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:04,552
That's what we
as adults call it.

49
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:09,757
When we actually lose our
sense of fun, our imagination,

50
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,361
and a whole lot of things
that I didn't want to give up.

51
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:17,064
When I was a kid, I thought,

52
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:20,501
"I'm gonna have a house,
where I can get up in the morning

53
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,670
"and go downstairs

54
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:26,607
"and open up
a giant glass wall

55
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,277
"and take a helicopter
out of my house

56
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,012
"and take off
right from my house

57
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,282
"and go anyplace
I want to go."

58
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:40,688
When I was a kid, I thought it would
be cool to have secret passages.

59
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:43,123
"I'm gonna put
secret passages in."

60
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:49,397
Some people want a classic
piece of artwork in their foyer.

61
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,432
A Monet. A Rembrandt.

62
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:57,037
In my foyer, I have
this old steam engine

63
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,773
built well over 150 years ago.

64
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:04,912
It actually ran a tugboat
called the HMS Oscar.

65
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:11,385
I would be terrified
to have to get on a horse.

66
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:15,423
Some great
big animal with teeth.

67
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:19,259
I don't wanna go near
a pile of muscle that big.

68
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:21,929
But I've never been afraid
of any machine.

69
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:26,066
That engine,
it's a work of art,

70
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,169
created by a different
kind of artist.

71
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:32,072
It also represents
great achievements

72
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,108
that took hundreds of years
to develop and understand.

73
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:43,751
When I'm awake, I'm working.

74
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:46,253
So I'm wearing
my work clothes.

75
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,756
Dean just doesn't
know the difference

76
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:50,090
between work and play.

77
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,292
So he always wears his jeans.

78
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:56,764
None of the kids like him.

79
00:04:56,797 --> 00:05:02,202
I have all the letters, and
this one I got from Dean. 1964.

80
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:06,106
"Dear Mommy and Daddy.
I want to come home."

81
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,941
Exclamation.

82
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,176
"If I can't come home,

83
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:12,312
"please send the following
as soon as possible.

84
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,115
"One accountant.

85
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,050
"One marketing expert.

86
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,020
"Three secretaries.

87
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:24,625
"I'll try to write again soon, but
I have to go to volleyball now.

88
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:28,228
"Your willful
and outcast son, me."

89
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:32,466
That was written then.

90
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,602
He wanted three secretaries.

91
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:41,409
I remember very well
being a little kid.

92
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:46,079
I'd think and I'd look at the
world and I'd imagine things.

93
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:49,349
Everything I saw gave me
questions about everything.

94
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:54,688
Why, when you bounce a ball,
each time it hits the ground,

95
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:57,124
it bounces lower
on the next shot.

96
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,427
How does it do that?

97
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,464
You put a hot cup
on the table,

98
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:05,866
it cools off.

99
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,769
You put a cold cup on
the table, it warms up.

100
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:12,072
How?

101
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,707
Why?

102
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:17,911
Most of what the world does
is quite amazing.

103
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:20,347
And you could be
very confident

104
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,116
that it'll always do the same
thing over and over again.

105
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,719
But how does all that happen?

106
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:27,621
There are a few people
that actually

107
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:30,057
took little pieces of that
and made sense out of it.

108
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:35,262
I asked my father for these
great scientists and thinkers.

109
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,531
They're beautiful art.

110
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:39,800
And they're done by my father.

111
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:43,437
You start with Archimedes.

112
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:47,174
Over 2,000 years later, we still
refer to Archimedes' principle.

113
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:51,645
Staggeringly,

114
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:56,984
after Archimedes, we had a few
things, which included the Dark Ages.

115
00:06:57,017 --> 00:07:01,121
We come out of them with
a guy like Leonardo da Vinci.

116
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:04,424
He was an artist
and an engineer,

117
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,426
a scientist.

118
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,096
I mean,
this guy was unbelievable.

119
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,766
And then you only have to wait
a few hundred years

120
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,569
to Galileo Galilei.

121
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:19,507
Really,
the first modern scientist.

122
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,609
He gave us
the scientific method.

123
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:24,745
He dies in 1642,

124
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:28,582
and we don't have to wait very
long, because in the same year,

125
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:31,485
Isaac Newton is born.

126
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,454
And Isaac Newton developed
Newtonian mechanics.

127
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:37,658
How masses move
and interact with each other.

128
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:44,097
Then, 1860s, comes
James Clerk Maxwell

129
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:48,301
and gives us what are now
known as Maxwell's equations.

130
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:52,372
Four statements that link
all of electricity, magnetism,

131
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,208
light,

132
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:58,211
into a comprehensive,
well-understood system.

133
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:03,083
And by 1905,
along comes Big Al.

134
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,487
He sort of put us
where we are today.

135
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:09,657
And I'm waiting for the next
big thing to happen.

136
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:15,796
Between this guy in 200 BC,

137
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:19,700
through this guy,
who was alive when I was born,

138
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,669
you've got 2,200 years.

139
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:24,905
And other than these six guys,

140
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:28,241
not much happened.

141
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:30,844
It's pretty humbling.
But it's, uh...

142
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,981
It's pretty exciting

143
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,816
to wonder about

144
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,685
what will be the contribution

145
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:41,021
of the next guy that deserves
a place on this wall?

146
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,756
Or woman.

147
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,482
Are you ready?

148
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:15,188
My middle brother has
most of the fame in the family

149
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,857
and he's known for Segway.

150
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,294
But the reality is he helped me
solve a problem we both used to say,

151
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:25,298
"You don't wake up in the morning
and say, 'I got to invent something.'

152
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:26,810
"You wake up in the morning
and you say,

153
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:28,702
"'There's a problem
to be solved.'"

154
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:33,941
I had just put a machine shop
in my parents' basement.

155
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:37,144
And I started building
electronics and selling it.

156
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:40,614
And then my brother would
come home from med school.

157
00:09:40,648 --> 00:09:45,418
He was already working on his basic
research, treating babies with leukemia.

158
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:47,921
That was his specialty.

159
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:50,724
But to deliver his new drugs
and new therapies,

160
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:53,060
you couldn't use all the
standard medical equipment,

161
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,062
because even at
their lowest rates,

162
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:58,431
they were 10 times
too high a rate for a baby.

163
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,811
I said, "Bart, why don't you
leave the drug

164
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:04,471
"in the syringe that it
came in in the first place?"

165
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:06,082
"And then we'll build you
a little device

166
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,908
"with a precision loader
that delivers it

167
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,310
"directly out of the syringe
into the baby."

168
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,612
So he said,
"That would be great."

169
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:16,016
But by giving him those
little drug delivery systems

170
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:18,518
that were seen by
all the rest of the faculty

171
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,588
when he was still a student
in med school,

172
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,491
all these other physicians
and researchers

173
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:27,260
saw these little things,
and said, "Wait a minute.

174
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,296
"Since it's small
and battery operated,

175
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,198
"I can slip it in the pocket
of some adult

176
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:33,176
"and they can leave the
hospital getting their drugs

177
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,668
"with a portable system."

178
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:36,636
Which didn't exist
in those days.

179
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,471
And then I start
to ask these docs, like,

180
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,207
"What do you plan to deliver?"

181
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:43,143
"How about insulin?"

182
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,947
We moved out of the basement,
we started making

183
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,717
lots of different pharmaceutical
delivery systems.

184
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,152
Ended up building
a nice company around that.

185
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,357
I like to work
on interesting problems,

186
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,692
technical problems,

187
00:10:58,726 --> 00:11:02,562
that if they are solved, also,

188
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:06,066
can be used by a whole lot of
people to make their lives better.

189
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:10,570
Which is why we spent
pretty much our whole career

190
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,773
at DEKA

191
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,242
building medical equipment.

192
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,353
The wiring has to go right
through the middle of it...

193
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:20,013
Right, so there's no rotation
of those components?

194
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:21,581
I'm an inventor.

195
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:23,150
What do inventors do?

196
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,685
Inventors look at problems,

197
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:29,622
the same problems everybody
else looks at, but see them differently.

198
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:35,028
We were working on a way to
make home dialysis a possibility.

199
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,666
Probably 20 years ago, we
said, "We can take dialysis.

200
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,701
"Let people do it at home.
Alone.

201
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,837
"Life support
in your own bedroom."

202
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:47,875
And most of the people
at Baxter said, "You're nuts."

203
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:51,178
In fact, throughout my life, I
only start on projects, typically,

204
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,014
if enough credible people
tell me, "You're nuts."

205
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:58,852
'Cause then you know,
"This must be a big problem."

206
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:03,256
Baxter had introduced the idea
of peritoneal dialysis.

207
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,725
The bad news is
while the therapy worked,

208
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,194
the machine,
that could, quote,

209
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:10,263
"Safely push this fluid
through a patient"

210
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:11,799
turned out to be this.

211
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:14,101
They loaded a bag up here

212
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:15,803
and you ran the tube
out of the bag,

213
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:18,605
not up to there, because
the fluid can't travel by itself...

214
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:21,117
They couldn't pump it, because if
something went wrong, you could...

215
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:24,377
Then you pulled the tube out and
then you opened up this little device...

216
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,147
Down to the floor... Made
a weight scale out of this

217
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,549
and they weigh the fluid
as it's coming out...

218
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,885
If the patient rolled over
and tugged on the tube,

219
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,453
took the bags
that were hanging here...

220
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:36,756
The patient had to run all that
stuff every day, or the nurse.

221
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:40,460
So we looked at this, and
said, "Baxter, it's a great therapy.

222
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,063
"You guys did
something unbelievable.

223
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,332
"But the implementation
of the solution

224
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:47,667
"is just too kludgy to fix.

225
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,502
"We got a better idea."

226
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:52,239
We said, "The problem isn't

227
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:56,476
"your machine is noisy, your
machine is heavy, or your machine is...

228
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:01,181
"The problem is this patient
doesn't have a functioning kidney."

229
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:04,784
We decided we could build a simple
machine that would allow patients

230
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:09,456
to dialyze themselves at home
without having to live in a hospital

231
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:11,424
or a dialysis center

232
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,326
every other day
for the rest of their lives.

233
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:17,965
It was a completely different
approach to a problem.

234
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:23,303
That machine needed
about five gallons

235
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:26,773
of pure, medical grade
water to operate.

236
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,843
If we could find a way to make
the purest water in the world

237
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:31,278
out of the tap water
in your home,

238
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,446
and turn it into
medical grade water,

239
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,283
we could eliminate the next
problem they were having.

240
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:39,819
Shipping all this water
all over the country.

241
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:46,459
We stared working on a machine to
turn tap water into water for injection.

242
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:50,630
It turned out that unless you
know everything about the water,

243
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,199
in the northeast, it has iron,

244
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:54,467
in other places,
it has other problems.

245
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,136
We decided that

246
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,038
a simple filter,
or a membrane,

247
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:00,740
or osmosis,
or activated charcoal

248
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,043
is unlikely to meet the need.

249
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:07,380
We decided we better go back to the
gold standard that the medical community

250
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:11,084
has used to make medical
grade water for 100 years.

251
00:14:11,118 --> 00:14:13,020
That is, distill it.

252
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:18,325
The problem is the energy
required to distill water

253
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:22,062
requires that you take water in its
liquid phase at room temperature

254
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:24,864
and not only get it hot enough
to boil, to get frothy,

255
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:27,834
we need to get it all
to turn into steam.

256
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,270
Nature does it,
because you got the sun.

257
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:32,105
The biggest nuclear plant
we've ever seen

258
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:35,342
sitting out there that could boil
all this water out of the ocean.

259
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,510
That's an enormous
amount of energy.

260
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,879
We don't have a lot of energy.

261
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:43,683
The magic of a vapor
compression distiller,

262
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,852
particularly the little one
that we've made,

263
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,687
is that the water comes in,

264
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,957
it gets boiled,
it gets condensed,

265
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,358
and it comes
out of the machine

266
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,961
just a tad warmer
than it went in,

267
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:56,196
'cause we took all the energy
back out of it.

268
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,598
And by recycling
all of that energy,

269
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:01,634
we reduced the requirements
of this machine

270
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:07,040
from 25,000 watts, which is
about 20 houses worth of power,

271
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:10,377
to less power than
a hand-held hair dryer.

272
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,945
So now you take our machine

273
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:15,615
and you plug it into any
normal outlet in a typical home

274
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,650
and it uses
a little bit of power.

275
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:22,322
But it just keeps recycling that
energy over and over and over again,

276
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:24,424
so that it's no big deal.

277
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:32,966
I am
a very slow learner.

278
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,436
I'm very flattered that
you think I'm a real genius.

279
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:40,974
But if I'm a genius, all I can
tell you is I am the slowest,

280
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:43,443
dumbest genius
you'll ever meet.

281
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:46,779
You just gotta read it

282
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,049
and read it again,

283
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,518
and read it again.

284
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,854
Think about it,
and think about it again,

285
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:58,958
and then, all of a sudden,
it all starts to make sense.

286
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,664
While in third grade,

287
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,933
when Mrs. Pfeffer said,

288
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:10,670
"Evelyn, I can't understand,
he is so bright.

289
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:13,640
"But he's not producing
as he should."

290
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,676
I was having, as a little kid,

291
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,146
a lot of trouble
learning to read.

292
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:23,383
If I would see letters
out of context,

293
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:26,786
or words that could
be "pots" and "stop"

294
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,855
and "saw" and "was,"

295
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:30,857
I couldn't tell them apart.

296
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:34,627
My older brother could read
enormously fast.

297
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,996
And I always figured
it was practice

298
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,866
or it was something
that I was doing wrong.

299
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:42,669
We were very concerned.

300
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:44,971
I don't know
that we broadcast it.

301
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,575
Yeah, I mean, I don't know,
but we weren't ashamed.

302
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:52,979
We took him for testing
to the local psychologist.

303
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,681
He was a non-reader.

304
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,186
I wish I could
find a way to not be dyslexic.

305
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:04,157
But if somebody said,
"But here's the cost."

306
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:09,028
If it took away something
else that I'm good at,

307
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:14,167
at this point in my life, I'd probably
say, "No, I'll stay with what I got."

308
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:17,237
Compared to other problems,
this one's not so bad.

309
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:21,941
And maybe it was a catalyst to help
me do other things particularly well.

310
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:35,222
Once we realized we could take everything
out of water, no matter what it is,

311
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:38,858
organics, toxins, metals,

312
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,295
we had a process to turn
anything into pure water.

313
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:46,299
Why is it only for the
special subset of people

314
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,901
that have a dialysis machine
in their own bedroom?

315
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:53,506
The scalability
of this solution

316
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,075
is what is
attractive about it.

317
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:58,945
The fact that it could be used
all over the world

318
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:00,713
in all environments

319
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:03,883
with all kinds of bad water.

320
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,752
That was sort of an epiphany.

321
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,156
We recognized that a huge

322
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:12,225
potential opportunity existed

323
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:14,394
for solving the world's
water problems

324
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,863
with a vapor
compression distiller.

325
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:22,602
That same machine
could be carried into villages

326
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:25,071
and allow a few hundred
million people,

327
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,106
or a few billion people,

328
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,776
to have the purest water
in the world.

329
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:38,185
I hadn't realized
how big the problem was.

330
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:40,420
Analysis suggests
the world will face

331
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:44,357
a 40% shortfall
of clean water by 2030.

332
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:46,926
We live on a planet
70% covered by water,

333
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,095
and we're fighting over
a half of a percent.

334
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,332
As things change,
water conflict will escalate.

335
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:53,433
Competition for water

336
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,435
between Israel,
Jordan and Syria

337
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,370
has turned the
once-mighty Jordan River

338
00:18:57,404 --> 00:18:58,838
into a trickle.

339
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,683
There's no way it's not
gonna effect everybody.

340
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:03,009
In Central America,
the lack of drinking water,

341
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:04,277
together with pollution,

342
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:06,279
are having a huge impact
on children's health.

343
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:09,115
Child mortality figures
are horrific in Afghanistan.

344
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,784
One child out of five
dies under the age of five

345
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,553
through drinking
polluted water.

346
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:16,122
Almost 50 children are
reporting in every day

347
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,458
with symptoms of
diarrhea and vomiting.

348
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:21,561
Here, four children
are forced to share one bed.

349
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:29,302
A million people

350
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:33,540
might die in Bangladesh alone
this year from contaminated water.

351
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:37,744
In the
underdeveloped world,

352
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:40,913
the average amount of time
per day spent by women

353
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:45,485
looking for water that's safe
for their kids is four hours.

354
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,654
And if it didn't turn out
to be the right stuff,

355
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,122
they spend the next day or two
burying their babies.

356
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,839
That shouldn't
be their choices.

357
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,941
They shouldn't
have to go that far.

358
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:11,244
They shouldn't have to
make the choice between

359
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:14,281
drinking the kind of stuff
you wouldn't give to your dog,

360
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:16,283
or not having anything at all.

361
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:21,588
Everybody else that's working
on the global water problem

362
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:26,926
is thinking of massive,
interconnected infrastructure.

363
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:33,333
They don't understand that the 21st-century
problem needs a 21st-century solution.

364
00:20:39,506 --> 00:20:42,609
There's a lot to be said for,
"Let's minimize risk.

365
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:44,577
"Let's know what we're doing."

366
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:51,217
But sometimes,
when the need is really big,

367
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,822
and the currently available
solutions are woefully inadequate,

368
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:58,825
it is appropriate
to put a stake in the ground

369
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:01,461
and say, "We're not doing it
the way we did it before.

370
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,964
"We gotta find
a totally new approach.

371
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:08,435
"It's time to change."

372
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:17,744
Why do you take on
these impossible tasks?

373
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:21,080
It's always, like,
the hardest thing.

374
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:24,116
What is... What compels you?

375
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,494
Well, first of all,
believe it or not,

376
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:30,156
I don't get up in the morning
and look in the mirror and say,

377
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:32,825
"Go after some
impossible problem.

378
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:34,594
"And make sure
to frustrate yourself

379
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:38,698
"beyond reasonable.
Again. Today.

380
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:40,767
"You've been doing it
on water for 15 years,

381
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,769
"just keep doing that."

382
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,372
I do not go look,
every morning,

383
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:51,444
for the most difficult problem on
which I can continue to frustrate myself

384
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,346
and all of my people and fail.

385
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,214
That's not the goal.

386
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,016
It's a consequence,
but not a goal.

387
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:03,556
Ginger piques
nationwide interest.

388
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,992
Will it just solve
world hunger?

389
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:10,697
I went to my office and there
were boom trucks with cameras.

390
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:13,466
"What's going on?"

391
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,902
And people were saying,
"Well, this is the headquarters

392
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:18,405
"of the place with
the great secret project

393
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:20,306
"that's gonna
change the world."

394
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,142
I didn't know about the leak,

395
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:26,879
but it certainly wasn't,
as many people suspected,

396
00:22:26,913 --> 00:22:29,382
a marketing scheme.

397
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:34,554
People were speculating,
it could beam you places,

398
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:39,659
it was a transporter,
like in Star Trek.

399
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:43,830
And I was worried from that day
forward that no matter what we did,

400
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:48,835
it would have the potential of
having people say, "Really? That's all?

401
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:51,738
"You turned lead into gold,
I was hoping for platinum."

402
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,073
After months of hype,

403
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:57,877
the wraps are coming off that
top-secret invention codenamed "IT."

404
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,012
I wanna know what "IT" is.

405
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:02,782
What is "IT"?
What does "IT" do?

406
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:06,018
And when will "IT" be
somewhere where I can buy one?

407
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,587
We're about to unveil
the invention

408
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,756
that's been the subject
of hundreds of media reports

409
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:11,357
in the topic of a
global guessing game.

410
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,725
Some say it will
change the world,

411
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:15,027
some say that it's gonna be
as broad as the Internet.

412
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:23,536
I'm tempted to say,
"That's it?"

413
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:27,507
But that can't be it.

414
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,722
Hey, you know what
would be really cool?

415
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:37,650
If it had four wheels and a compartment
where people could sit inside.

416
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:47,159
Ginger is the evolution
of walking.

417
00:23:47,193 --> 00:23:49,095
First, we crawled
on all fours.

418
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:53,165
No, first we climbed
out of the ocean.

419
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:55,134
Then, we were
four-legged beasts.

420
00:23:56,335 --> 00:23:58,871
And then we learned
to walk erect.

421
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,674
And now,

422
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:03,476
We ginger.

423
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:08,414
People that live in cities, people that
only wanna move around a small community

424
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:11,851
shouldn't be using
a 4,000-pound machine

425
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:14,654
to move their
150-pound ass around town.

426
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,925
What are these?

427
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,527
Oh, good.

428
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,597
I like to work on projects
where there's a discontinuity.

429
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:27,333
Where you can't use
linear thinking

430
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:30,269
to get from A to B to C
to where we are.

431
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,072
You have to take
a big intellectual leap.

432
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:38,044
Greetings, foot people.

433
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:41,948
How are things
back in the 20th century?

434
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,716
Gentlemen, forward!

435
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:48,054
The traditional Segway,
as far as I know,

436
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:50,890
made a huge splash
when it came out in 2002.

437
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:53,225
But is it true that it's
only sold about 50,000?

438
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:54,994
What went wrong there?

439
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:56,672
Well, I think the problem for
the Segway was really the price.

440
00:24:56,696 --> 00:24:59,532
At about $5,000,
it's a pretty expensive toy.

441
00:25:01,267 --> 00:25:04,136
In retrospect,
there's probably lots of ways

442
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:07,674
to go back and play the
coulda-woulda-shoulda-mighta.

443
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:09,241
Could it have been cheaper?

444
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:11,811
Could we have addressed
the market differently?

445
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:14,246
But we didn't do
either of those.

446
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,784
And what difference would
that have made, we'll never know.

447
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:20,286
Very smooth!

448
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:25,658
I don't think my perspective of the
Segway has changed very much.

449
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:28,494
It really is that connection,

450
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,764
that segway between
walking and cars.

451
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,703
I don't know what people
will be doing in 10 or 20 years

452
00:25:36,736 --> 00:25:39,739
when there's nine or ten
billion people on this planet,

453
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:41,540
most of them living in cities.

454
00:25:41,574 --> 00:25:44,243
But I know one way
they won't be doing it.

455
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:48,881
They won't be sitting in
3,000-pound machines called cars,

456
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:52,218
creeping along, sucking up
each other's exhaust.

457
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:53,786
That's insane.

458
00:25:57,123 --> 00:25:59,759
Are there three items
you can't live without?

459
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:02,795
You mean that exist today,
or that I hope will exist soon?

460
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:04,697
Either one.

461
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:06,699
Well, you know,
the one that, sadly,

462
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:09,068
I don't think will
come about in my lifetime,

463
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:11,570
the one I've always wanted
is a time machine.

464
00:26:11,604 --> 00:26:13,572
The only thing
that ever really scares me

465
00:26:13,606 --> 00:26:16,575
is the fact that life is short

466
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:18,377
and you can't do everything.

467
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:22,615
I work as much as I can, as hard
as I can, but you can't do everything.

468
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:34,560
The only thing we have
that we can't make any more of

469
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:35,795
is time.

470
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:42,001
There's an eternity behind me,

471
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:44,003
and I will never
get to experience that.

472
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:47,740
I won't see the big bang,
I won't know how it happened.

473
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:49,776
I won't even be able to see

474
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:52,078
things of a mere 100 or 200
or 300 years ago.

475
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:53,412
I will not be able to see

476
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,115
Lincoln deliver
the Gettysburg Address.

477
00:26:57,784 --> 00:27:00,486
There's a long timeline,
then I was born.

478
00:27:01,654 --> 00:27:04,023
And then in a
relatively short time,

479
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:06,358
a dot along that line,
I'm gone.

480
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:11,263
And there'll be
a very long future out there.

481
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:12,999
I won't be
part of that, either.

482
00:27:13,032 --> 00:27:17,469
So in that very short segment
of this nearly infinite line,

483
00:27:17,503 --> 00:27:23,375
where I have the capacity to see the
world and understand and do things,

484
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:25,311
I don't intend
to waste any of it.

485
00:27:29,048 --> 00:27:32,618
Why is everybody saying that
there's a looming water shortage?

486
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,787
Okay? Why?

487
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:37,356
Well, how about 50%

488
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:40,126
of all human disease
on this planet today

489
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,994
is a result of
water-borne pathogens.

490
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:44,030
So people drink the water,
the disease is in it,

491
00:27:44,063 --> 00:27:45,965
and then they get sick?
50%.

492
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,234
How about... Stop drinking
water. That's my point.

493
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:54,140
Most organizations,
when they want to clean water,

494
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:57,076
first say, "What's
wrong with the water?"

495
00:27:57,109 --> 00:28:01,313
And if it's ocean water, they say,
"Let's use osmosis membranes."

496
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:03,916
If it's water that's got
heavy metals in it,

497
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,218
they put charcoal filters
in front of it.

498
00:28:06,252 --> 00:28:09,021
If it's water that's got
bioburden in it,

499
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:12,691
they say, "Let's use
antibiotics or chlorine

500
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:15,061
"or something to kill
the bioburden."

501
00:28:15,094 --> 00:28:18,931
But you had to know which
of those processes to use

502
00:28:18,965 --> 00:28:21,500
for any particular problem
with the water,

503
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:25,104
and you had to have access
to that particular solution.

504
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:28,007
"No, no, no. We'll just
use chlorine tablets."

505
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,275
Well, that's great.

506
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:31,186
As long as you can run down
to the local 7-Eleven

507
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,612
to buy the tablets,
pretest the water.

508
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,214
Oh, wait a minute, you can't.

509
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:36,548
They don't even have roads.

510
00:28:37,817 --> 00:28:40,086
You can't imagine
that in these little villages,

511
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:41,553
they have, oh,

512
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:43,589
an epidemiologist,
a microbiologist,

513
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:47,026
an organic chemist,
somebody to...

514
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:50,229
So I decided, you gotta take a
different approach to the problem.

515
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:52,031
We've seen
in the last generation,

516
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:54,066
we went from Ma Bell,

517
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,602
big, centralized systems
to cellphones.

518
00:28:56,635 --> 00:29:01,874
We went from big, mainframe
computers to personal computing.

519
00:29:01,908 --> 00:29:05,044
Why can't we go
in the same way

520
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:07,579
in the developing world
to point of use generation

521
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:09,248
of pure, clean water
out of anything,

522
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,818
instantly where you need it?

523
00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:17,489
You have to build a box,
maybe the size of this,

524
00:29:17,523 --> 00:29:21,593
that is a simple to operate
water utility.

525
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:34,240
This is an early
version of my black box.

526
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:38,077
We made it black, we
want it rugged to sit outside.

527
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,914
If you touch it, it feels like
the bed liner of a Chevy truck.

528
00:29:41,948 --> 00:29:43,415
People ask me
what it's made out of.

529
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:45,852
It's actually made out of
the bed liner of a Chevy truck.

530
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:51,423
Because I wanted it rugged and I
figured those guys know how to do that.

531
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:53,292
You've got
an incredible invention here.

532
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:55,995
Um, tell me what this does.

533
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:58,931
That box is a vapor
compression distiller

534
00:29:58,965 --> 00:30:02,501
with no filters, no membranes,
no chemicals.

535
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:05,437
You can stick one hose that
comes out of it, which I'll show you,

536
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:07,515
into any source of water...
So this thing right here?

537
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,551
This is the dirty water?
Over here? That's dirty water.

538
00:30:09,575 --> 00:30:11,477
You stick a hose
into anything that looks wet,

539
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,179
Anywhere in the
world... A puddle?

540
00:30:13,212 --> 00:30:14,556
- A puddle, the ocean.
- The ocean.

541
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,882
A chemical waste site.

542
00:30:15,915 --> 00:30:18,384
A latrine.
50 gallon drum of urine.

543
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:21,053
A 50 gallon drum of urine.
Okay.

544
00:30:21,087 --> 00:30:25,291
And it comes through this
machine and it comes out here

545
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,994
as perfect, distilled water.

546
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:33,065
We said,
"What if we make a system

547
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:36,168
"that might have a
sophisticated technology inside,

548
00:30:36,202 --> 00:30:39,638
"but the use of it is simpler
than all the others?"

549
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:43,542
So no substance put in there,
except the water,

550
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,711
will actually end up
in the water over there?

551
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:47,984
That's correct. I'm gonna
put that to the test right now.

552
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,851
Let me help you.
All right.

553
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:54,053
I guarantee you,

554
00:30:56,622 --> 00:30:57,689
that water's gonna be

555
00:30:57,723 --> 00:30:59,892
sweet, spicy
and chili flavored.

556
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:03,862
Thank you, sir.

557
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:09,001
Dean's now
the official clapper.

558
00:31:09,035 --> 00:31:11,170
- You are, you are...
- I'm gonna put a credit.

559
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,272
I need a credit for that.

560
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,945
Truth is transient.

561
00:31:18,978 --> 00:31:21,813
And there's no place where
the truth is more transient

562
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:24,050
than in technology.

563
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:27,686
What was true when you
were a kid about technology

564
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,756
is probably not true anymore.

565
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:33,692
The idea that somebody
in a little village

566
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,295
in Ghana, or in Bangladesh,

567
00:31:36,328 --> 00:31:38,264
that has no electricity today,

568
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:40,766
or has no tap water today,
the idea that

569
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,134
tomorrow morning

570
00:31:42,168 --> 00:31:44,603
somebody there is
gonna wake up, "Oh, look,

571
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:46,638
"transmission line,
switch gear,

572
00:31:46,672 --> 00:31:49,075
"high voltage, low voltage,
transformers."

573
00:31:49,108 --> 00:31:52,744
The idea that that's suddenly
gonna appear out of nowhere

574
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:54,080
is ridiculous.

575
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:57,216
If you want
a good example

576
00:31:57,249 --> 00:32:01,320
of where technology helped
transform the developing world,

577
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:03,655
think of the difference
between

578
00:32:03,689 --> 00:32:06,392
big, centralized phone systems

579
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:08,827
and cell phones.

580
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,930
There are 400 million
cell phones in Africa.

581
00:32:11,964 --> 00:32:15,301
There are a billion
cell phones in India.

582
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,071
Global organizations,

583
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:23,909
they work on top-down
government-to-government big programs,

584
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,278
and we're working on bottom-up

585
00:32:26,312 --> 00:32:29,115
point of use generation
of water.

586
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:40,926
I was told a very long time
ago, when I started my business,

587
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:45,631
that I'd never get anywhere
without partners and without a tie.

588
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:47,599
So I figured I'd kill
two birds with one stone.

589
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:50,102
I had a tie made out of denim

590
00:32:50,136 --> 00:32:52,171
and I gave it to my partner.

591
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:55,907
So I've had this guy in
my office now for 30 years.

592
00:32:56,742 --> 00:32:58,944
We've never had an argument.

593
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,447
Uh, he's always supportive.

594
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,449
He's my partner,
my silent partner,

595
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:06,185
and, uh, he's good
to have in the office.

596
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,121
...saw, my friend,
Dean Kamen,

597
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:11,157
whom I have known
for more than 20 years.

598
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:14,593
I saw the Segway before
most people knew what it was.

599
00:33:16,195 --> 00:33:19,065
And a few years ago, we were out
in Colorado together, and he said,

600
00:33:19,098 --> 00:33:22,534
"I've got this
water purification deal

601
00:33:22,568 --> 00:33:25,504
"and it can
revolutionize the world.

602
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:27,806
"And here's how it works."

603
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,576
He never made me
ride the Segway.

604
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:32,811
He never made me get up
in that

605
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,581
wheelchair that climbs up
the stairs.

606
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:38,917
I never had to take any risks
to brag on Dean Kamen.

607
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:43,422
He pours this awful fetid
water into this machine

608
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:45,591
and it drips down,
and he says,

609
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:47,059
"Now drink it."

610
00:33:50,796 --> 00:33:52,831
And so...

611
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,334
I did.

612
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,902
And I'm still here,
it works.

613
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:04,410
So this is a machine
we built in 2006.

614
00:34:04,443 --> 00:34:08,046
We'll lift the insulating case
off and show you what's inside.

615
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:11,850
The very first units we built,

616
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,852
which required a few years,

617
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,422
times a few dozen engineers,

618
00:34:16,455 --> 00:34:19,691
cost literally
millions of dollars apiece.

619
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:22,361
This is made out of,
as you know, expensium.

620
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:25,597
Where's the unobtainium?
Most of what's in here is

621
00:34:25,631 --> 00:34:27,699
made out of unobtainium.

622
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:31,237
We do have all the
unreliabilium in here.

623
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:34,740
Um... And, uh,

624
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:37,075
the icantmaketwoathem
is in here.

625
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:52,991
My father had one mood.

626
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,227
He was happy.

627
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:58,397
He loved what he did.

628
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,533
And he wanted to sit
and do art.

629
00:35:03,169 --> 00:35:05,937
- You got me in there?
- Oh, you're in.

630
00:35:05,971 --> 00:35:08,807
One of the tales
Dean would tell,

631
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,076
somebody asked him
about his father's work

632
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:14,146
and he says, "You know, I
don't think my father ever slept."

633
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,248
He said,
"I'd wake up in the morning

634
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:18,317
"and my dad was
at the drawing board.

635
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:22,754
"And I'd go to sleep at night, and my
dad was sitting at the drawing board."

636
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:25,090
I work about eight
to 10 hours a day.

637
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,692
Still?
Yeah.

638
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:29,761
My father was not
one of those.

639
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:32,097
Leave It to Beaver fathers.

640
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,933
After dinner,
all the other kids

641
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:38,270
and the fathers would go out
and play ball on the streets.

642
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:39,771
My father would finish dinner

643
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:42,608
and go upstairs to where
he had his second studio

644
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,343
and he would be working.

645
00:35:44,376 --> 00:35:46,945
And I would sit there
watching him.

646
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,547
And I basically said to him,

647
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,782
"Dad, you know,
I feel badly for you,

648
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:53,118
"'cause all the other fathers
come home from work

649
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,120
"and they get to play
with their kids.

650
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,356
"But you have to go back
to work."

651
00:35:57,389 --> 00:35:59,191
He put down his brush

652
00:35:59,225 --> 00:36:03,229
and he said, "Dean,
don't ever feel sorry for me.

653
00:36:03,262 --> 00:36:05,964
"I love what I do.
I'm an artist.

654
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,834
"I get to do something I love
all the time.

655
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:13,605
"You need to find something
that you love to do.

656
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:17,175
"And then you'll be
the lucky guy."

657
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,546
I'm the luckiest guy
in the world.

658
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:24,149
I get up every day knowing
that there's important things

659
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,586
that I really
wanna accomplish.

660
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:31,790
I tell every kid I meet, "Figure
out something you really love to do,

661
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:35,394
"get so good at it

662
00:36:35,427 --> 00:36:38,230
"that you can make a living
doing it.

663
00:36:38,264 --> 00:36:39,865
"If you don't do that,

664
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:43,535
"you're cheating yourself out
of a happy, meaningful life."

665
00:36:45,404 --> 00:36:46,705
Now, jump.

666
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,310
- What do you think?
- Good.

667
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:55,080
May I have
your attention, please.

668
00:36:55,113 --> 00:36:57,115
After we had
refurbished them,

669
00:36:57,148 --> 00:37:00,586
I took the first floor
of one of my old mills

670
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:03,054
and built it into
a hands-on science center

671
00:37:03,088 --> 00:37:05,424
that I donated
to the community.

672
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:10,362
One morning, I walked
into the little science center

673
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:12,598
and I noticed that almost
every kid in the place

674
00:37:12,631 --> 00:37:15,033
was wearing a sweatshirt
or a jersey

675
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:18,404
that was about the Patriots,
or the Bruins.

676
00:37:18,437 --> 00:37:21,283
And I happened to stop and say to
one of them wearing one of these jerseys,

677
00:37:21,307 --> 00:37:25,311
"Can you tell me the name
of a famous living engineer?"

678
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:27,946
No, I can't.

679
00:37:29,448 --> 00:37:32,250
You know, we gotta fix that.

680
00:37:32,284 --> 00:37:35,621
And I just went around to every
kid and say, "Could you tell me

681
00:37:35,654 --> 00:37:39,591
"the name of some role model,
scientist, engineer, inventor?"

682
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:42,227
And not a single one could.

683
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,763
One of the adults finally
said to me,

684
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:48,300
"Einstein,
but I think he's dead."

685
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:53,104
There's nothing wrong with
having great superheroes

686
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:56,575
from the world of sports, and
entertainment, and the arts,

687
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,077
but you'd think
there'd be room for

688
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,247
a few people that contribute
to society by curing disease,

689
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,751
or creating cell phone
technology, or...

690
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:08,320
You just look at what we take
for granted

691
00:38:08,354 --> 00:38:11,790
and nobody has any idea
how it got here.

692
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,926
But somehow we think
it's remarkable

693
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,164
that this guy
can get the ball in the hoop

694
00:38:19,197 --> 00:38:22,934
at a slightly higher percentage
than somebody else.

695
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:24,670
It's just amazing.

696
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,274
Anyway, I walked out of there

697
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:32,210
and decided I'm gonna build
an organization,

698
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:35,113
the purpose of which is

699
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,791
to change the culture
of the United States.

700
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:40,819
People, get ready,
the robots are coming.

701
00:38:51,897 --> 00:38:55,333
FIRST is an organization
whose sole goal

702
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:57,803
is to convince a generation
of kids

703
00:38:57,836 --> 00:39:00,806
that science and technology
and engineering

704
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:03,008
actually is fun

705
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:06,978
and accessible, and rewarding,
and important.

706
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:09,715
They already feel that way
about sports.

707
00:39:09,748 --> 00:39:11,182
So we said,

708
00:39:11,216 --> 00:39:15,387
"Let's package science,
technology, engineering and math

709
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:18,023
"into a
sporting competition."

710
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:22,193
The kids working with
world-class scientists and engineers

711
00:39:22,227 --> 00:39:24,095
build a robot

712
00:39:24,129 --> 00:39:28,033
that's gonna compete with, literally
at this point, thousands of other robots.

713
00:39:29,635 --> 00:39:32,003
FIRST was set up
on the premise

714
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:35,507
that we don't have an
education problem in this country,

715
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:37,876
we have a culture problem.

716
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:41,012
The only difference between
this sport and all the others

717
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:45,751
is every kid
on our teams can turn pro.

718
00:39:45,784 --> 00:39:49,020
There's a job out there
for every one of these kids.

719
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:51,723
Thank you.

720
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,760
Lots of people ask me

721
00:39:54,793 --> 00:39:57,696
why I put so much
of my own energy into FIRST.

722
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:00,832
Oh, you're the sophomore?
We got you for three years. Okay.

723
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:03,034
Go to a FIRST event,

724
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:05,904
walk through the pits,
talk to the kids.

725
00:40:05,937 --> 00:40:09,541
I am very confident that
in those stands is some kid

726
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:13,645
that's gonna win a Nobel Prize
for curing a major disease,

727
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:15,581
or creating a new technology.

728
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:20,586
FIRST is another one of my
almost overnight successes.

729
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,722
It's only been 21 years.

730
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:26,592
And it's gonna be an overnight
success, I'm sure, this coming season.

731
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:30,662
I'm still waiting
to where I can say.

732
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:35,634
FIRST is where it
should be, which is

733
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:37,936
in every school
in the country.

734
00:40:38,804 --> 00:40:41,607
I've been accused of being

735
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,843
too aggressive
about the need for FIRST.

736
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:48,446
So I've decided to be
the new gentler Dean.

737
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,018
I no longer say, "We need FIRST
in every school in the country."

738
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:56,988
We only need FIRST in the schools
where you care about the kids.

739
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:05,296
He'd be a good father.
He'd be a tremendous father.

740
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:08,967
But, uh...

741
00:41:12,738 --> 00:41:16,675
As a matter of fact,
several years ago, I said,

742
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:18,877
"I promise, I'll take
care of the baby

743
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:21,813
"until the baby
is housebroken."

744
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:33,992
Of the many decisions
I've made in my life,

745
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:37,062
one that I am totally
confident was the right one

746
00:41:38,897 --> 00:41:40,832
was not to have children.

747
00:41:43,535 --> 00:41:45,537
Am I willing to devote

748
00:41:46,271 --> 00:41:48,540
virtually my whole life

749
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,743
to my children?

750
00:41:51,777 --> 00:41:54,546
Could I do that
without being resentful?

751
00:41:56,582 --> 00:41:58,817
I doubt it.

752
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:03,021
The funny thing is, every child
that comes into the building

753
00:42:03,722 --> 00:42:06,491
always runs to Uncle Dean.

754
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,927
He picks them up,
plays with them.

755
00:42:09,728 --> 00:42:10,896
Every one of them.

756
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:14,532
Every decision you make

757
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,268
is a set of compromises.

758
00:42:19,404 --> 00:42:22,774
The only thing we have a
finite amount of is our time.

759
00:42:23,775 --> 00:42:25,543
I'm not a Superman,

760
00:42:25,577 --> 00:42:27,779
and I couldn't

761
00:42:29,748 --> 00:42:34,019
be as good a parent
as my parents were to me

762
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:38,089
and still do all the other things
that I feel compelled to do.

763
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:44,930
So I will live with the fact
that I had great parents

764
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,701
and I tried to do things
for the world and other kids

765
00:42:49,735 --> 00:42:54,740
that in some ways are a testament
to what my parents did for me.

766
00:42:56,608 --> 00:42:59,244
But I don't need to
go down that road.

767
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,756
Inventions really are, I
think, a lot like children.

768
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:15,060
You make them, and generally,

769
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:19,064
you're surprised
by what you did,

770
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:20,598
but after 17 or 20 years,

771
00:43:20,632 --> 00:43:23,935
they both sort of go off to
the world, and never look back.

772
00:43:28,707 --> 00:43:31,076
As currently envisioned,
the SlingShot

773
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:35,446
will produce 1,000 liters
of pure water every day

774
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,183
from any kind of impure water.

775
00:43:38,216 --> 00:43:41,252
A thousand liters
of water a day

776
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:46,124
is enough for a hundred people
to all have plenty of water to drink,

777
00:43:46,858 --> 00:43:49,861
to cook, and for hygiene.

778
00:43:49,895 --> 00:43:53,464
And the goal is that machine
will continue to do that

779
00:43:53,498 --> 00:43:57,703
without much maintenance or
overhaul for at least three years,

780
00:43:57,736 --> 00:44:01,272
by which time it will have
produced a million liters

781
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:03,374
of clean water per machine.

782
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:09,180
We worked on the machine with
the mental model of sooner or later

783
00:44:09,214 --> 00:44:12,951
it'll reach the time when
we have to try it somewhere

784
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,386
outside of our own lab.

785
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,622
And, uh, you know,

786
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,791
I would've liked a little
more time, but as they say,

787
00:44:19,825 --> 00:44:22,828
"The safest place for a ship
is in the harbor.

788
00:44:22,861 --> 00:44:25,196
"It just doesn't
do you any good there."

789
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:27,465
We needed to send
this thing out

790
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:31,036
and we needed to
get real feedback.

791
00:44:31,069 --> 00:44:35,741
So I decide
we gotta test these machines.

792
00:44:35,774 --> 00:44:38,076
So I took some
of my engineers.

793
00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:41,012
They're not exactly international
travelers, but what the hell?

794
00:44:41,046 --> 00:44:44,916
And we supported the trial just
to see whether the technology

795
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:49,120
would be accepted into those
environments and perform as we expected.

796
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:59,430
At the time
we sent machines to Honduras,

797
00:44:59,464 --> 00:45:03,835
I was sort of, but maybe not
completely, ready to let them go.

798
00:45:03,869 --> 00:45:08,006
I knew that that machine was
delicate, fragile,

799
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:10,075
very, very handmade.

800
00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:12,443
This is crazy.

801
00:45:12,878 --> 00:45:14,445
But Hector says,

802
00:45:14,479 --> 00:45:16,748
"No problema."

803
00:45:16,782 --> 00:45:18,216
Lord help us.

804
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,519
But I also knew,

805
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:24,689
sooner or later,
you've gotta run the risk

806
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:27,192
of letting people
really use something.

807
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:29,394
And we had reached that point.

808
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,332
Okay, here it is.

809
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:39,437
June 3rd, at about
1:30 in the afternoon,

810
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:42,107
we're starting to fill
the product bag.

811
00:45:43,308 --> 00:45:44,442
Water's going in.

812
00:45:45,944 --> 00:45:48,213
We just put it
in this little town

813
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:50,715
and said any kid
on the way to school

814
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:53,618
can come and get
a 20 liter jug of water.

815
00:45:53,651 --> 00:45:55,386
The first week,
it was all boys,

816
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,932
'cause as we all know, there's
no reason for girls to go to school.

817
00:45:57,956 --> 00:45:59,757
But after about a week,

818
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:02,593
we noticed
something really surprising.

819
00:46:02,627 --> 00:46:06,965
Suddenly, all the families decided
the girls ought to go to school, too.

820
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:10,936
That was a pretty nice,
unplanned

821
00:46:10,969 --> 00:46:13,604
side effect or benefit
of this program.

822
00:46:16,975 --> 00:46:20,078
We proved our machine
does what we said it would do

823
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:22,814
with the locally
available water,

824
00:46:22,848 --> 00:46:26,852
and that the community
saw the value of it.

825
00:46:26,885 --> 00:46:29,320
The bad news is we noticed
that most people

826
00:46:29,354 --> 00:46:34,025
would transfer it into a bowl or a
pot, or something that was not clean,

827
00:46:34,059 --> 00:46:36,594
and they'd have
their hands in it.

828
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:40,798
And we realized they didn't understand
that just because we made it clean,

829
00:46:40,832 --> 00:46:42,667
it's not gonna magically
stay that way.

830
00:46:44,235 --> 00:46:47,138
Clearly, we needed
to give them better ways

831
00:46:47,172 --> 00:46:50,475
to move it and to store it, and
we needed to give them education

832
00:46:50,508 --> 00:46:53,611
about what to do
and not to do with the water.

833
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,046
And DEKA

834
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:58,816
is a small R&D company
in Manchester, New Hampshire.

835
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:01,386
We have not only
no global reach,

836
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:04,789
we have no marketing,
no sales, no distribution.

837
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,926
The experience in Honduras
made it really clear

838
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:10,996
that just delivering
the machine

839
00:47:11,029 --> 00:47:12,563
is not gonna
solve the problem.

840
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:17,903
People accept new ideas
very slowly.

841
00:47:17,936 --> 00:47:21,639
In the 1840s
and '50s and '60s,

842
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,408
the telegraph had come along.

843
00:47:23,441 --> 00:47:24,976
Click, click, click,

844
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:27,012
and a telegram
could go anywhere.

845
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:32,317
Alexander Bell realizes,
instead of clicking a switch,

846
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:33,851
it could use
the same infrastructure

847
00:47:33,885 --> 00:47:35,921
that Western Union
put in place.

848
00:47:35,954 --> 00:47:40,658
But instead of sending a telegraph
key signal, you could send voice.

849
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,760
Watson? Come here, I want you.

850
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:45,997
Alexander Bell was, of
course, all excited about this.

851
00:47:46,031 --> 00:47:50,168
He goes to the biggest company
out there, as the story goes.

852
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:52,770
The board of directors
of Western Union

853
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:55,373
basically said,
"You've done a beautiful job

854
00:47:55,406 --> 00:48:00,078
"of making this novelty that
you've just demonstrated to us,

855
00:48:00,111 --> 00:48:04,715
"but of what use would this be
in a serious business?"

856
00:48:04,749 --> 00:48:09,554
It didn't take very long before he
became essentially Bell Telephone,

857
00:48:10,055 --> 00:48:11,856
AT&T.

858
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,859
And Western Union
scrambled for years

859
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,295
to try to go back
and buy those patents,

860
00:48:17,328 --> 00:48:20,398
to catch up, because they had
all that infrastructure.

861
00:48:20,431 --> 00:48:22,167
But they never did.

862
00:48:24,502 --> 00:48:28,273
You gotta be an optimist,
if you try to do this stuff.

863
00:48:28,306 --> 00:48:32,443
If you asked me 15 years ago
how long did I think it would take?

864
00:48:32,477 --> 00:48:35,947
I would've said,
"I don't know, a year or two."

865
00:48:35,981 --> 00:48:38,649
And I would've believed
that I can make this

866
00:48:38,683 --> 00:48:39,951
and then I'll show it
to people,

867
00:48:39,985 --> 00:48:41,662
and then the light bulb
will go on in their head

868
00:48:41,686 --> 00:48:45,957
and they'll see the opportunity
and success will be imminent.

869
00:48:48,459 --> 00:48:51,963
I think the reason
that the SlingShot problem

870
00:48:51,997 --> 00:48:55,066
turned out to be so long

871
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:59,637
is because it isn't just
a technology problem.

872
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:03,041
How are you gonna get these
machines to the people that need them?

873
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:06,244
And we started to worry.

874
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:08,813
How are we gonna
make that happen?

875
00:49:08,846 --> 00:49:10,948
Why isn't this a success?
I made it work,

876
00:49:10,982 --> 00:49:13,451
it technically does the job,
it takes less than a kilowatt.

877
00:49:13,484 --> 00:49:15,086
Why doesn't it work?

878
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:19,057
Well, I decided, "It's
the distribution, stupid."

879
00:49:20,825 --> 00:49:22,960
I'm pretty stupid.

880
00:49:22,994 --> 00:49:26,364
We realized
that without a partner

881
00:49:26,397 --> 00:49:30,268
that has an efficient,
effective means

882
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:32,137
of delivering these machines

883
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:36,974
and the associated information and
knowledge and education about them,

884
00:49:38,143 --> 00:49:41,012
we'd never be able
to turn this thing

885
00:49:41,046 --> 00:49:43,948
from the science fair project
that it was

886
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:47,418
into an innovation that could
spread around the world.

887
00:49:49,587 --> 00:49:51,656
What do you want
to do with this?

888
00:49:51,689 --> 00:49:54,025
Well,
since 1.1 billion people,

889
00:49:54,059 --> 00:49:57,895
20% of the world's population,
goes to bed every night sick or thirsty,

890
00:49:57,928 --> 00:50:00,698
because they don't have access
to water, clean water,

891
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:02,400
we thought we'd put
these in production,

892
00:50:02,433 --> 00:50:04,669
figure out how to get them
placed around the world

893
00:50:04,702 --> 00:50:07,638
and we'd wipe out
50% of human disease.

894
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,558
I made a machine that I thought
would help people with healthcare.

895
00:50:17,582 --> 00:50:18,983
That's my day job.

896
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:22,720
So I went to my medical
company clients. They can help.

897
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:25,356
They pretty much said,
"We can't help you.

898
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:27,234
"We'd love to support it.
We'll help you with money.

899
00:50:27,258 --> 00:50:30,995
"But, Dean, we can't get this
stuff to these places, either."

900
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,563
We'll see what we can do.

901
00:50:34,465 --> 00:50:36,000
I went to governments.

902
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:38,369
Maybe that's what they're for.

903
00:50:38,403 --> 00:50:40,205
When capitalism doesn't work,

904
00:50:40,238 --> 00:50:43,174
aid organizations, NGOs.

905
00:50:43,208 --> 00:50:46,511
Well, they like to deal
with big-scale stuff.

906
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:49,080
They also might help
with funding, they told me,

907
00:50:49,114 --> 00:50:51,682
but these big organizations
don't have

908
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:54,185
people that go out
to these little villages.

909
00:50:54,219 --> 00:50:56,321
They don't have an efficient
distribution channel.

910
00:50:58,089 --> 00:51:02,527
I went to the United Nations,
said, "I've got this box.

911
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,695
"Let's figure out
how to help get it out there."

912
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:08,466
Their basic answer was, "Good
for you, we're rooting for you.

913
00:51:08,499 --> 00:51:12,303
"But we don't do that.
We don't distribute products.

914
00:51:12,337 --> 00:51:16,040
"We don't build sustainable
micro-economic systems.

915
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:19,210
"We don't lend people money,
we don't make entrepreneurs.

916
00:51:19,244 --> 00:51:21,246
"That's not what we do."

917
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:25,283
I was somewhat disappointed.

918
00:51:25,316 --> 00:51:31,156
I believe all of these global
organizations want us to succeed.

919
00:51:31,189 --> 00:51:35,726
But it's a different way of thinking
that we're delivering to them.

920
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:40,064
Otherwise, they're going to a
place that they haven't been before.

921
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:43,901
And getting people to do that
is very hard.

922
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:48,873
Innovation is a very
difficult, frustrating process.

923
00:51:54,779 --> 00:51:56,381
I was probably...

924
00:51:57,148 --> 00:51:59,284
I don't remember, but young.

925
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:02,787
Probably eight or nine,

926
00:52:03,788 --> 00:52:06,824
when I had just gotten
a new bicycle.

927
00:52:08,293 --> 00:52:11,629
I was just riding it
around and around the block.

928
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,266
Then this kid jumped out,

929
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,968
grabbed the bike,
pushed me off it,

930
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:22,473
and told me
he didn't want to see

931
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:27,712
this Jew riding
around the block.

932
00:52:30,181 --> 00:52:33,518
And I was lying there,
and I knew

933
00:52:33,551 --> 00:52:36,521
that if I didn't ride around
the block again,

934
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:40,358
I would just feel like
I'd been defeated.

935
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:45,230
And to this day I remember
looking up at this guy

936
00:52:45,263 --> 00:52:47,365
and saying,

937
00:52:47,398 --> 00:52:49,834
"I'm not gonna fight
with you now.

938
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,637
"That would be stupid.

939
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:56,341
"I'm quite sure
you could easily beat me up.

940
00:52:57,542 --> 00:52:59,210
"But I'm gonna get
on my bicycle

941
00:52:59,244 --> 00:53:02,547
"and I'm gonna ride around
this block again,

942
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:06,050
"and if you stop me, you
better be prepared to kill me."

943
00:53:09,787 --> 00:53:12,423
And I just looked him
right in the eye,

944
00:53:13,391 --> 00:53:15,360
and he just walked away.

945
00:53:16,727 --> 00:53:20,665
And I got back on the bicycle
and I rode around the block

946
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:23,668
again, and again, and again

947
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:26,337
until it started getting dark.

948
00:53:26,371 --> 00:53:28,373
And he never, ever

949
00:53:29,874 --> 00:53:31,542
bothered me again.

950
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:40,818
One of my all-time
favorite quotes,

951
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,588
not by an inventor, per se,

952
00:53:43,621 --> 00:53:46,056
but a guy dealing
with some really big problems,

953
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:47,925
Douglas MacArthur,

954
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:49,394
who said,

955
00:53:49,427 --> 00:53:54,799
"In war, as in every
other human endeavor,

956
00:53:54,832 --> 00:53:57,602
"failure can be summed up
in two words.

957
00:53:58,803 --> 00:54:00,305
"'Too late.'"

958
00:54:03,674 --> 00:54:07,545
I don't wanna be too late
delivering water.

959
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:12,283
Every year that we wait, another
couple of million people die,

960
00:54:12,317 --> 00:54:13,984
most of them kids.

961
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:19,424
On the one hand,
I am the entrepreneur in heat,

962
00:54:19,457 --> 00:54:21,926
who always thinks
everything takes too long.

963
00:54:21,959 --> 00:54:25,095
Every project I've ever done,
it takes too long.

964
00:54:25,129 --> 00:54:26,263
On the other hand,

965
00:54:26,297 --> 00:54:28,899
that's another
few million people dying,

966
00:54:28,933 --> 00:54:31,369
because we started
production late.

967
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,804
We gotta get going.

968
00:54:45,816 --> 00:54:47,952
This is a really,
really big day.

969
00:54:53,691 --> 00:54:54,925
I've been given
the opportunity

970
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:56,961
to talk to the entire
board of directors

971
00:54:56,994 --> 00:54:58,796
of the Coca-Cola Company

972
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:02,933
about using our
vapor compression distiller

973
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:06,036
to solve the major
global health problem,

974
00:55:06,671 --> 00:55:08,005
bad water.

975
00:55:24,422 --> 00:55:25,790
We're flying to Atlanta,

976
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:28,125
we're currently
at 40,000 feet.

977
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:31,362
We're flying
at about 433 knots,

978
00:55:31,396 --> 00:55:33,498
a little over 500 miles
an hour.

979
00:55:33,531 --> 00:55:36,467
12-3, 653.

980
00:55:36,501 --> 00:55:39,169
Lots of people have
asked me, "Why Coke?"

981
00:55:42,006 --> 00:55:43,474
It's called FIRST.

982
00:55:43,508 --> 00:55:44,709
And a goal!

983
00:55:44,742 --> 00:55:47,978
Final 4, Round 2 has begun!

984
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:50,815
It grew so big, it had so many
teams from around the country

985
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:54,018
that it outgrew any venue
in the state.

986
00:55:54,051 --> 00:55:57,221
We needed
a major sports arena,

987
00:55:57,254 --> 00:56:02,660
and we realized we could put it
in the home of the 1996 Olympics.

988
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:05,830
The 70,000 seat Georgia Dome
in Atlanta.

989
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:07,932
And we're setting up
down there at this big arena

990
00:56:07,965 --> 00:56:09,534
and you look up
and what's the biggest,

991
00:56:09,567 --> 00:56:12,136
most visible building
on the skyline?

992
00:56:13,137 --> 00:56:15,272
And it suddenly hits me.

993
00:56:15,305 --> 00:56:18,042
Is there some company
in the world

994
00:56:18,075 --> 00:56:20,377
that gets its product
everywhere?

995
00:56:20,411 --> 00:56:21,912
Every little village?

996
00:56:21,946 --> 00:56:23,113
Yeah.

997
00:56:24,449 --> 00:56:27,818
The Coca-Cola Company
has bottling operations

998
00:56:28,453 --> 00:56:30,855
in 206 countries,

999
00:56:30,888 --> 00:56:33,691
which is more
than the number of countries

1000
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:36,561
that are admitted
into the United Nations.

1001
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:39,897
It turned out,

1002
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:41,932
fortunately for us,

1003
00:56:41,966 --> 00:56:44,101
that they had
some of their own problems.

1004
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:50,107
They said to us, "We haven't
really updated our fountain system

1005
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:52,743
"in decades."

1006
00:56:52,777 --> 00:56:56,581
Do I have a passion to get up in
the morning and work on that project?

1007
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,149
Hmm, not so much.

1008
00:56:59,183 --> 00:57:00,651
But I said to them,

1009
00:57:00,685 --> 00:57:03,721
"I'll help you with your
machines, you help me with mine."

1010
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:06,256
And, literally,
we had a handshake

1011
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:09,426
with their chairman
who said to me, "We'll try."

1012
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,964
A couple of years
and a lot of effort later,

1013
00:57:13,998 --> 00:57:16,366
we delivered
and they introduced

1014
00:57:16,967 --> 00:57:18,969
their freestyle machine.

1015
00:57:19,003 --> 00:57:21,338
We went back
to Muhtar Kent and said,

1016
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:23,240
"Now let's figure out

1017
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:27,512
"how we can work together on
the other box, my water machine."

1018
00:57:27,545 --> 00:57:28,913
...2-6 clear to land.

1019
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:30,748
The wind's 210...

1020
00:57:33,818 --> 00:57:35,986
If Coca-Cola decided

1021
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:38,489
that it is
in their best interest,

1022
00:57:38,523 --> 00:57:40,791
it's in the
world's best interest

1023
00:57:40,825 --> 00:57:46,664
that we quickly deploy, literally,
hundreds of thousands of these machines,

1024
00:57:46,697 --> 00:57:48,332
they could do it.

1025
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,987
What are you gonna say
to people about Coke's

1026
00:58:01,011 --> 00:58:03,614
earlier troubles with water?

1027
00:58:03,648 --> 00:58:06,851
Well, I think we've now come
to live in a world of sound bites,

1028
00:58:06,884 --> 00:58:10,287
where everybody wants a simple

1029
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,891
one-sentence, or in some case,
one-word answer.

1030
00:58:13,924 --> 00:58:16,293
And in our culture,
we have people that think

1031
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:18,629
businesses is the source
of all evil

1032
00:58:18,663 --> 00:58:21,899
and other people that
think the opposite.

1033
00:58:21,932 --> 00:58:26,503
All those simplistic answers have
the advantage that they're simple.

1034
00:58:26,537 --> 00:58:29,540
They all have the disadvantage
that they're wrong.

1035
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:40,184
No Pepsi, no Cola!

1036
00:58:40,217 --> 00:58:41,819
We want drinking water!

1037
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:43,220
No Pepsi, no Cola!

1038
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:44,822
We want drinking water!

1039
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:47,692
For every liter of soft
drink the company makes,

1040
00:58:47,725 --> 00:58:50,494
it has to extract three liters
of water.

1041
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,496
And angry farmers
claim that Coke

1042
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:55,733
is literally sucking the water
from beneath their feet.

1043
00:58:55,766 --> 00:58:59,536
Coca-Cola has been asked to
pay $47 million in compensation

1044
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:01,038
for alleged
environmental damage

1045
00:59:01,071 --> 00:59:03,574
caused at a bottling plant
in Southern India.

1046
00:59:03,608 --> 00:59:05,610
The plant,
one of its largest there,

1047
00:59:05,643 --> 00:59:10,514
was forced to close in 2005 after massive
nationwide protests against the company.

1048
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:13,851
- No Pepsi, no Cola.
- We want drinking water.

1049
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:17,855
Unbridled power by anybody,
a government agency,

1050
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:21,859
a corporation, is always
potentially dangerous.

1051
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:25,562
But in the end,
most companies work hard

1052
00:59:25,596 --> 00:59:29,199
to earn the respect and trust
of their customers

1053
00:59:29,233 --> 00:59:32,236
because it's in their
enlightened best interest.

1054
00:59:39,176 --> 00:59:41,045
We all
have to conserve water

1055
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:45,916
and therefore, Coca-Cola
has been the first business,

1056
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:51,622
in a way, that has declared a
goal of water neutrality by 2020.

1057
00:59:51,656 --> 00:59:54,659
Nobody treats water
with dignity in the world.

1058
00:59:54,692 --> 00:59:56,894
Everybody thinks it's free,
it's available,

1059
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:58,829
and then we have said
that by 2020,

1060
00:59:58,863 --> 01:00:01,565
we are going to globally
become water neutral.

1061
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:05,269
That means, give back to
the world every liter of water

1062
01:00:05,302 --> 01:00:09,907
that we use in our beverages and to
make our beverages. That you take.

1063
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:12,643
I think
it's a waste of energy,

1064
01:00:12,677 --> 01:00:15,012
and it's a disservice
to ourselves

1065
01:00:15,045 --> 01:00:17,381
to look for
who we're gonna blame.

1066
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:21,185
And I think,
if we can orchestrate

1067
01:00:21,218 --> 01:00:24,755
what government does well,
what NGOs do well,

1068
01:00:24,789 --> 01:00:26,490
what giant corporations
do well,

1069
01:00:26,523 --> 01:00:28,458
what little inventors do well,

1070
01:00:28,492 --> 01:00:32,462
the result of that is we
make the world a better place.

1071
01:00:32,496 --> 01:00:34,431
By sitting around
trying to figure out

1072
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:37,835
which one of those entities
is a bad guy,

1073
01:00:37,868 --> 01:00:39,469
we do nothing.

1074
01:00:46,844 --> 01:00:49,279
Wait a minute,
isn't it Sunday now?

1075
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:52,683
So I get double overtime.

1076
01:00:54,084 --> 01:00:56,486
So that's triple overtime.

1077
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,956
Where's Jimmy Hoffa
when I need him?

1078
01:01:01,325 --> 01:01:04,228
My mother calls,
as all mothers do,

1079
01:01:04,261 --> 01:01:07,965
"I'm still worried, Dean, you're
working too hard, you're running too far.

1080
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:10,400
"You need to just slow down."

1081
01:01:10,434 --> 01:01:13,403
"Okay, Mother.
I agree with you."

1082
01:01:13,437 --> 01:01:17,574
"So should I
stop doing FIRST?" "No."

1083
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:22,346
"Okay, I'll stop working on
that medical product." "No."

1084
01:01:22,379 --> 01:01:25,249
"Okay, I'll just stop working
on the water machine

1085
01:01:25,282 --> 01:01:28,418
"we hope to supply
to families around the world,

1086
01:01:28,452 --> 01:01:32,222
"so two million babies
will have clean water." "No."

1087
01:01:32,256 --> 01:01:37,361
"Okay, Mother, which of the things I
am working on do you recommend I stop?

1088
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:39,329
"Which ones?"

1089
01:01:39,363 --> 01:01:41,631
And there's never
a good answer.

1090
01:01:43,367 --> 01:01:45,102
So I keep going.

1091
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:53,210
Some people like to play golf.
Let them go play golf.

1092
01:01:55,645 --> 01:01:57,447
We agreed with
the Coca-Cola Company

1093
01:01:57,481 --> 01:02:01,718
that we would go out
and build 15 machines

1094
01:02:01,752 --> 01:02:06,456
in this pilot production run
to be used in trials.

1095
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:10,360
We were gonna be in five
different schools in Ghana

1096
01:02:10,394 --> 01:02:12,963
and then from there,
depending on how those trials go,

1097
01:02:12,997 --> 01:02:16,834
we're moving to other places
around Africa and Central America.

1098
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:02,406
Huh? Okay, it depends.

1099
01:04:57,327 --> 01:05:00,797
There were so many
horror stories we had heard,

1100
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:06,803
of attempts to do something
like bring clean water to places,

1101
01:05:06,836 --> 01:05:10,274
that had ended in failure,
not for technical reasons,

1102
01:05:10,307 --> 01:05:14,378
but for social, economic,
financial, political reasons.

1103
01:05:23,954 --> 01:05:26,390
I was afraid that, once again,

1104
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:28,825
it's gonna be
a science fair project

1105
01:05:28,858 --> 01:05:31,461
and not an innovation
that spreads through

1106
01:05:31,495 --> 01:05:34,264
that community
in that part of the world.

1107
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:45,609
Going, going, going, going...

1108
01:05:45,642 --> 01:05:47,177
Gone.

1109
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:21,778
When the first
images came back

1110
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:25,815
and we saw
a crowd of excited kids

1111
01:06:25,849 --> 01:06:29,619
smiling and laughing, and watching
these kids just guzzle this water down,

1112
01:06:31,688 --> 01:06:37,527
everybody realized that our
ideas are one step closer to reality.

1113
01:06:48,205 --> 01:06:51,808
So, as all of you know,
probably, only too well,

1114
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:56,213
I am a big believer that the
last thing you ever want to do

1115
01:06:57,247 --> 01:06:59,816
is relax,

1116
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:02,152
go take a nap
on that bear skin rug,

1117
01:07:02,186 --> 01:07:04,821
before you're sure
you shot the bear.

1118
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:07,891
This bear ain't dead yet.

1119
01:07:07,924 --> 01:07:12,196
But even I think sometimes
it's nice to take a little bit of time

1120
01:07:12,796 --> 01:07:14,298
to celebrate.

1121
01:07:15,799 --> 01:07:17,667
Couple of weeks ago,

1122
01:07:17,701 --> 01:07:21,538
we finally got in writing
with signatures on it, the deal.

1123
01:07:21,571 --> 01:07:25,075
We are partners now
with the Coca-Cola Company.

1124
01:07:25,109 --> 01:07:30,380
We've gotta deliver no less
than 50 working machines

1125
01:07:31,115 --> 01:07:33,083
of the next generation,

1126
01:07:33,117 --> 01:07:36,220
half the weight
and half the size,

1127
01:07:36,253 --> 01:07:38,755
deliverable by
the end of this year.

1128
01:07:40,257 --> 01:07:43,993
You know, if it works,
and we supply water,

1129
01:07:45,795 --> 01:07:50,767
we will have potentially supplied
more healthcare through this project,

1130
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:54,838
than the sum total of all the
projects we've done in 30 years.

1131
01:07:57,474 --> 01:07:58,908
So, Jim,

1132
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:02,045
don't screw it up.

1133
01:08:05,615 --> 01:08:06,983
Cheers!

1134
01:08:09,353 --> 01:08:10,754
To all of you!

1135
01:08:16,693 --> 01:08:18,295
Stewart, Stewart...

1136
01:08:18,328 --> 01:08:19,663
Have some pizza, will you?

1137
01:08:19,696 --> 01:08:23,233
These people are way too smart
not to be scared.

1138
01:08:27,337 --> 01:08:29,839
Now, eat the pizza.

1139
01:08:30,707 --> 01:08:33,076
And drink the beer.

1140
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,578
And then get back to work.

1141
01:08:39,283 --> 01:08:42,085
A long time ago,
in a faraway place,

1142
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:45,088
I, literally,
designed the circuit boards.

1143
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:49,559
I etched them in the ferric
chloride dish in my mother's oven.

1144
01:08:51,228 --> 01:08:54,964
These days, I have
400 extraordinary people,

1145
01:08:54,998 --> 01:08:57,834
and each has some specialty

1146
01:08:57,867 --> 01:09:00,770
that is in a different
zip code of capability

1147
01:09:00,804 --> 01:09:03,139
in their specialty
than I ever was.

1148
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,376
Well, let's do that again.

1149
01:09:09,513 --> 01:09:12,148
You hit me in the nose,
you're dead.

1150
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:18,121
Dennis, I got good news
and bad news. What's that?

1151
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:20,790
These things are working...

1152
01:09:20,824 --> 01:09:25,128
To make one more of the
models of the machine you've seen,

1153
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:28,164
I say to the 20 people
in there,

1154
01:09:28,198 --> 01:09:31,635
"You make the compressor wheel
out of that block of aluminum.

1155
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:34,571
"You make this part
out of steel."

1156
01:09:34,604 --> 01:09:37,974
You add up the cost of all those
people and all those resources,

1157
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:41,411
and it turns out, it costs
hundreds of thousands of dollars

1158
01:09:41,445 --> 01:09:43,680
to put another model
out there.

1159
01:09:48,285 --> 01:09:51,187
In five out of five
locations in Ghana,

1160
01:09:51,221 --> 01:09:54,258
we met every
expectation we had

1161
01:09:54,291 --> 01:09:56,493
for performance
and acceptance,

1162
01:09:56,526 --> 01:09:58,495
and we sadly confirmed,

1163
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:02,332
yup, the basic machine is
too heavy to bring to scale,

1164
01:10:02,366 --> 01:10:04,401
it's too expensive
to bring to scale,

1165
01:10:04,434 --> 01:10:06,670
and it was too hard to set up

1166
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:11,375
and deal with the sometimes
erratic access to electricity.

1167
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:17,514
And as a result
of that experiment,

1168
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:22,752
we said, "Let's figure out how to make
them more cost-effective to manufacture,

1169
01:10:22,786 --> 01:10:27,891
"smaller and lighter,
and let's do the next round."

1170
01:10:27,924 --> 01:10:31,561
So I know we're going with the
plastic housing, instead of the aluminum,

1171
01:10:31,595 --> 01:10:33,630
but that aluminum rotor,

1172
01:10:33,663 --> 01:10:35,765
and all that machining
was obviously...

1173
01:10:35,799 --> 01:10:37,233
Costly.
Right.

1174
01:10:37,267 --> 01:10:41,237
How are we doing that? So we're
gonna go to an injection-molded rotor,

1175
01:10:41,271 --> 01:10:42,939
just like we did
with the housings.

1176
01:10:42,972 --> 01:10:44,608
Right, so there's your rotor.

1177
01:10:44,641 --> 01:10:45,675
So...

1178
01:10:46,476 --> 01:10:48,378
Plastic rotor.
Yep.

1179
01:10:52,416 --> 01:10:56,320
Our trials would be
one, two, three machines.

1180
01:10:57,787 --> 01:10:59,956
What we're calling
the "Alpha Build,"

1181
01:10:59,989 --> 01:11:03,960
will be between 50
and 100 identical machines.

1182
01:11:03,993 --> 01:11:07,163
In a real factory,
in a period of a month,

1183
01:11:07,196 --> 01:11:10,534
you could stamp out
10,000 machines,

1184
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,437
not one.

1185
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:18,141
The labor cost associated with that
10,000 machines is almost nothing.

1186
01:11:20,677 --> 01:11:24,914
To make one more machine then,
is the cost of these finished parts,

1187
01:11:24,948 --> 01:11:28,652
which we will get down to a
few thousand dollars per machine.

1188
01:11:29,653 --> 01:11:33,022
This device will be less
than half the size,

1189
01:11:33,056 --> 01:11:35,625
less than half the weight
of the machines

1190
01:11:35,659 --> 01:11:37,661
that we used
for the Ghana trials.

1191
01:11:37,694 --> 01:11:42,532
And the goal is to have them all
finished for the next level of testing

1192
01:11:42,566 --> 01:11:46,102
in Central America
and in Africa.

1193
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:49,005
And if that project
goes as we hope,

1194
01:11:49,038 --> 01:11:54,711
the next round of development should
be relatively high-volume production

1195
01:11:54,744 --> 01:12:00,584
to start the serious project of
giving water to a few billion people.

1196
01:12:07,557 --> 01:12:11,728
I think somebody
that's a really big person

1197
01:12:11,761 --> 01:12:18,067
is somebody that doesn't mind
helping everybody else around them.

1198
01:12:18,101 --> 01:12:24,140
A really big person helps
everybody else be big,

1199
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:28,745
and doesn't use their bigness
to keep everybody else small.

1200
01:12:33,417 --> 01:12:35,351
My brother was a big person.

1201
01:12:39,222 --> 01:12:42,225
Libby, my niece, is here.

1202
01:12:42,258 --> 01:12:45,194
She's been with FIRST
her whole life.

1203
01:12:45,228 --> 01:12:46,596
She lost a dad.

1204
01:12:48,632 --> 01:12:50,233
I lost a brother.

1205
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:54,103
My mom

1206
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:58,141
lost her son.

1207
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:02,979
The whole FIRST community

1208
01:13:03,747 --> 01:13:07,216
lost a great resource.

1209
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:11,254
He was a mentor,
he was a volunteer,

1210
01:13:12,456 --> 01:13:15,191
he was a judge.

1211
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:18,895
He was somebody everybody
could aspire to be like.

1212
01:13:21,898 --> 01:13:25,234
What I admired about Bart

1213
01:13:25,268 --> 01:13:29,272
was he had a little bit of my
father in him that I don't have.

1214
01:13:29,305 --> 01:13:32,041
That he was so easy-going.

1215
01:13:32,075 --> 01:13:36,646
And he was always conscious of making
everybody around him feel comfortable,

1216
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:39,415
which was an incredible asset,

1217
01:13:39,449 --> 01:13:42,552
since the people around him,
most of the time, were little kids,

1218
01:13:42,586 --> 01:13:45,121
that would otherwise be
scared to death because

1219
01:13:46,189 --> 01:13:47,323
they have cancer.

1220
01:13:50,093 --> 01:13:51,761
Patrick.

1221
01:13:52,962 --> 01:13:54,731
Just a month ago. Yeah.
Thank you.

1222
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:56,933
You stay very, very healthy.

1223
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:01,805
It never even
came into my head

1224
01:14:01,838 --> 01:14:05,609
that I'd get old, and not
be able to call my brother.

1225
01:14:08,011 --> 01:14:11,648
I believe, right now, I can
pick up the phone and call him.

1226
01:14:13,316 --> 01:14:14,784
I can't...

1227
01:14:14,818 --> 01:14:17,954
I can't really believe that
that's not the case.

1228
01:14:23,627 --> 01:14:25,028
Life is so short.

1229
01:14:28,397 --> 01:14:30,667
And Bart's passing

1230
01:14:31,868 --> 01:14:34,203
just gives me
even more urgency.

1231
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:38,708
My whole life,

1232
01:14:38,742 --> 01:14:42,779
every time I thought of something
good and important to do,

1233
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:44,681
I wanted to do it now.

1234
01:14:46,583 --> 01:14:49,218
It's not a coincidence
I build clocks.

1235
01:14:50,554 --> 01:14:53,056
'Cause the world's in a race.

1236
01:14:53,089 --> 01:14:55,491
Between all sorts
of catastrophes,

1237
01:14:56,225 --> 01:14:58,227
and technical expertise.

1238
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:02,165
We can't let catastrophe win.

1239
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:07,671
So time is critical.

1240
01:15:17,847 --> 01:15:21,685
Coca-Cola selected
ideal locations

1241
01:15:21,718 --> 01:15:23,953
for the next level of testing.

1242
01:15:24,688 --> 01:15:26,089
Mexico,

1243
01:15:26,122 --> 01:15:27,591
South Africa,

1244
01:15:27,624 --> 01:15:29,859
Paraguay.

1245
01:15:29,893 --> 01:15:35,364
What we're learning is, if there are
206 different countries on this planet,

1246
01:15:35,398 --> 01:15:40,904
we have to ask ourselves at least
206 different ways to be successful,

1247
01:15:40,937 --> 01:15:43,873
because in each environment,
there are different challenges.

1248
01:15:49,145 --> 01:15:53,016
The ideal would be a machine
that has no weight, no size,

1249
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:55,518
no cost, never breaks down,

1250
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:58,888
is available wherever you
need it, all the time, free.

1251
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:02,859
That will never happen.

1252
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:07,196
There is, I think, a very
pervasive but naive assumption

1253
01:16:07,230 --> 01:16:10,700
that aid means
you give things away.

1254
01:16:10,734 --> 01:16:12,401
If you give things away,

1255
01:16:12,435 --> 01:16:14,604
with this mythical idea

1256
01:16:14,638 --> 01:16:16,572
that it should have no cost,

1257
01:16:17,807 --> 01:16:20,343
it will end up demonstrating
that it had no value.

1258
01:16:42,298 --> 01:16:46,970
It will be those people that are
drinking the output of this device

1259
01:16:47,003 --> 01:16:50,674
that are protecting it,
maintaining it,

1260
01:16:50,707 --> 01:16:53,643
in some cases,
creating a business around it

1261
01:16:53,677 --> 01:16:55,712
and becoming entrepreneurs.

1262
01:16:58,047 --> 01:17:01,617
The Wright brothers flew
at Kitty Hawk in 1903.

1263
01:17:03,219 --> 01:17:06,489
The day after they did that,
you didn't see airlines.

1264
01:17:06,522 --> 01:17:09,092
You didn't get
frequent flyer miles.

1265
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:13,930
In fact, I believe, it was at
least a decade after they did that,

1266
01:17:13,963 --> 01:17:17,801
before anybody had any
commercial use of any airplane.

1267
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:23,439
Where we were with the first
machines that you saw in Ghana,

1268
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:28,111
we were like the Wright
brothers, with their first flyer.

1269
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:30,880
Where are we now
with our Alpha machines?

1270
01:17:30,914 --> 01:17:35,551
We're one of those early airplanes
with the big propellers, spitting smoke.

1271
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:39,455
Where would we like to be
with our next machine?

1272
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:41,290
You know, the dream liner.

1273
01:17:41,324 --> 01:17:43,626
Where do we want
to be after that?

1274
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:45,194
A spaceship.

1275
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:56,372
I think the reason that water is
such a big problem these days

1276
01:17:56,405 --> 01:18:01,310
is because all the people in the
western world don't see it as a problem.

1277
01:18:01,344 --> 01:18:02,912
In fact,
they don't even see it at all.

1278
01:18:04,881 --> 01:18:07,250
Even here, in the richest
country in the world,

1279
01:18:07,283 --> 01:18:11,654
our pure clean water isn't as
pure and as clean as we thought.

1280
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:16,525
Sadly, most of us will probably
come to see a world where

1281
01:18:16,559 --> 01:18:19,729
you can't trust
tap water anymore.

1282
01:18:19,763 --> 01:18:21,865
At least 41 million of us

1283
01:18:21,898 --> 01:18:26,235
are drinking water that contains
traces of prescription drugs.

1284
01:18:26,269 --> 01:18:29,372
Anti-seizure medications,
prescription pain killers.

1285
01:18:29,405 --> 01:18:33,276
Even the anti-depressant
ingredient in Prozac.

1286
01:18:33,309 --> 01:18:36,913
There are, literally, for instance,
tens of millions of women

1287
01:18:36,946 --> 01:18:39,082
that are taking birth control.

1288
01:18:39,115 --> 01:18:44,387
And every day, they literally
pass through their body, hormones

1289
01:18:45,588 --> 01:18:49,025
that municipal water systems
can't filter out.

1290
01:18:49,058 --> 01:18:52,195
And tiny, tiny, tiny
amounts of hormones

1291
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:56,732
have a big effect
on your health.

1292
01:18:56,766 --> 01:19:00,036
The average age of puberty for
young girls in the United States

1293
01:19:00,069 --> 01:19:03,572
has been dropping
pretty radically.

1294
01:19:03,606 --> 01:19:08,377
The problem of global access to
water is getting worse everywhere,

1295
01:19:08,411 --> 01:19:12,982
including, in the next
decade or two, North America.

1296
01:19:13,016 --> 01:19:15,751
There will be many places
around this country,

1297
01:19:15,785 --> 01:19:19,188
where water becomes
a serious issue.

1298
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:24,760
Everybody asks me, "Well, why
do we call the box SlingShot?"

1299
01:19:24,794 --> 01:19:28,431
As a little kid, I was always
the smallest kid in my grade,

1300
01:19:28,464 --> 01:19:31,167
and I heard the story
of David and Goliath,

1301
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:36,439
and to me, the moral of that
story was, "Technology is cool."

1302
01:19:36,472 --> 01:19:39,943
And people say to me, "How?
How did you get that moral out of it?"

1303
01:19:39,976 --> 01:19:42,578
I say, "Well, there was
this really little guy, David.

1304
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:44,848
"He had this really
big problem, Goliath.

1305
01:19:44,881 --> 01:19:47,516
"But he had this little
thing called the slingshot.

1306
01:19:47,550 --> 01:19:51,988
"And that little piece of technology
took out that really big problem."

1307
01:19:55,491 --> 01:19:57,793
Dean, where are you? Stand up.

1308
01:19:57,827 --> 01:20:00,129
Now, let me tell you.

1309
01:20:00,163 --> 01:20:03,332
About seven years ago,
I did drink

1310
01:20:03,366 --> 01:20:06,769
some of the ugliest, most
contaminated water you ever saw.

1311
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:08,938
Dean came and put it
in his little machine,

1312
01:20:08,972 --> 01:20:12,108
I drank it down, and
I'm still here. It works.

1313
01:20:13,542 --> 01:20:15,211
I mean, it works.

1314
01:20:15,244 --> 01:20:16,612
I drink it all the time.

1315
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:20,984
It works and it is just an
amazing piece of equipment.

1316
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:26,155
You start putting
all these pieces together

1317
01:20:26,189 --> 01:20:31,995
and the chain will finally go from a
crazy idea to, "Of course. It was obvious."

1318
01:20:32,028 --> 01:20:34,563
Let's put water machines
all over the world.

1319
01:20:34,597 --> 01:20:38,301
There's no easier way to wipe
out 50% of all human disease.

1320
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:40,136
Let's just do it.

1321
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:42,005
- Simple.
- Overnight success?

1322
01:20:42,038 --> 01:20:46,009
I think in less than 20 years, we're
gonna be an overnight success.

1323
01:20:50,513 --> 01:20:55,418
We want to be helping get
water to everybody on this planet.

1324
01:20:55,451 --> 01:20:56,852
It's the right thing to do.

1325
01:20:56,886 --> 01:20:58,554
It's simply
the right thing to do.

1326
01:20:58,587 --> 01:21:02,658
We can do it.
Therefore, we should do it.

1327
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:06,095
So why is it prevention
to give people clean water?

1328
01:21:06,129 --> 01:21:07,496
Call me crazy.

1329
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:09,065
We have
a Department of Defense

1330
01:21:09,098 --> 01:21:13,502
and we build the ultimate
weapons of mass destruction.

1331
01:21:13,536 --> 01:21:18,074
But how about if we build
weapons of mass construction?

1332
01:21:18,107 --> 01:21:20,585
And what if we go around the
world and give everybody clean water,

1333
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:24,180
and it says "US" on it,
your friend?

1334
01:21:24,213 --> 01:21:26,382
Maybe we'll have
a Department of Peace.

1335
01:21:26,415 --> 01:21:29,585
And maybe
we will prevent the wars.

1336
01:21:29,618 --> 01:21:33,122
And if we can get these water
machines into high volume production,

1337
01:21:33,156 --> 01:21:35,191
I think we put them
around the world

1338
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:40,696
and there's a way better shot
that a large part of two billion people

1339
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:42,498
will be our friends.

1340
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:47,470
I don't have time for things
that just don't matter.

1341
01:21:47,503 --> 01:21:52,408
So, number one, is I'd like to work
on big problems and solve them.

1342
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:54,710
Number two,

1343
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:58,247
is at least I'll be able to say to the
world, "I worked on a really big problem.

1344
01:21:58,281 --> 01:22:02,551
"I didn't solve it, but I
tried. What did you do?"

1345
01:22:02,585 --> 01:22:06,255
And at least, I hope in the
end, I didn't waste my time.

1346
01:22:08,958 --> 01:22:10,793
What I really, really want

1347
01:22:12,361 --> 01:22:14,730
is a time machine.

1348
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:17,466
If I could step
into some device

1349
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:19,635
and transport myself back

1350
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:23,606
to have a conversation, 2,300
years ago with Archimedes...

1351
01:22:25,474 --> 01:22:29,112
"Hey, Archi. What's up with
that buoyancy thing?" You know...

1352
01:22:29,145 --> 01:22:30,846
I don't know what I'd say.

1353
01:22:32,148 --> 01:22:37,486
Or if I could go forward
even just 100 years,

1354
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:41,624
will they have answers to questions
that we simply don't understand now?

1355
01:22:41,657 --> 01:22:46,195
And will they be answers that
are, "Oh, why didn't we see that?"

1356
01:22:46,229 --> 01:22:48,631
Do you think
you could build one?

1357
01:22:49,832 --> 01:22:52,535
As I said, whenever you
talk about technology,

1358
01:22:52,568 --> 01:22:57,606
using a word like "never"
always comes back to haunt you.

1359
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:01,010
We will cure every kind of
cancer you can think of.

1360
01:23:01,044 --> 01:23:05,381
We will make computers that outperform
anything you could possibly imagine.

1361
01:23:06,649 --> 01:23:10,286
I don't say "never"
to just about anything,

1362
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:13,789
but I'll say
it's gonna be a long time

1363
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:15,691
before there's a time machine,

1364
01:23:15,724 --> 01:23:19,795
especially one that has
the beautiful convenience

1365
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:22,798
of what H.G. Wells
had in mind.

1366
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:26,469
Get in it, dial in a time,
get out.

1367
01:23:26,502 --> 01:23:29,638
Get back in,
dial in a different time.

1368
01:23:29,672 --> 01:23:32,041
Now, that's an invention.

1369
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:37,012
If anybody,
or any group of people

1370
01:23:37,046 --> 01:23:39,982
come up with
a device to do that,

1371
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:42,118
they deserve the whole wall.

1372
01:23:48,057 --> 01:23:49,558
Are you ready?

1373
01:23:49,592 --> 01:23:51,260
Are we all watching?

1374
01:23:51,294 --> 01:23:52,928
This is pressure.

1375
01:23:54,697 --> 01:23:56,832
Dean, higher.
Oh, I failed!

1376
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:58,767
Oh, all right, all right.

1377
01:23:58,801 --> 01:23:59,968
Ready?

1378
01:24:08,911 --> 01:24:10,746
You know,
I don't want to say anything,

1379
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:14,250
but I think I reached
the pinnacle of this.

1380
01:25:58,354 --> 01:26:01,290
For you to be thanking
me, it makes my brain hurt.

1381
01:26:01,324 --> 01:26:06,329
I mean, it's the veterans that gave
me the opportunity to do all these things.

1382
01:26:06,362 --> 01:26:09,565
And I thank all of you...

1383
01:27:56,104 --> 01:28:00,909
We could empty half of all the
beds in all the hospitals in the world

1384
01:28:00,943 --> 01:28:03,779
by just giving people
clean water.
