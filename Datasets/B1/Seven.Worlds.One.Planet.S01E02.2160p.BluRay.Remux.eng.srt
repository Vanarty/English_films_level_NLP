1
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:41,959
Asia - the largest
of all the Earth's continents.

2
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:50,676
It stretches from the equator
to beyond the Arctic Circle.

3
00:00:53,137 --> 00:00:56,807
This is a continent of extremes.

4
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:07,401
Here, temperatures can drop
to below minus 60 degrees Celsius.

5
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:12,782
On land, survival is almost impossible.

6
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:18,329
But for a few weeks in summer,

7
00:01:18,454 --> 00:01:22,875
the ice melts
and the coast is transformed.

8
00:01:33,678 --> 00:01:37,515
This is one of the biggest gatherings
of mammals

9
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,143
to be found anywhere on Earth.

10
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:37,700
These are Pacific walrus.

11
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:42,663
For most of the year
they feed out in the Arctic Ocean,

12
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:45,374
emerging to rest on the sea ice.

13
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:51,464
But now climate change has
melted the ice here,

14
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:56,052
and the only place within reach of
their feeding grounds where they can rest

15
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:59,305
are a few beaches, such as this one.

16
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:07,938
100,000 of them, almost the entire
world population, are here.

17
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:14,820
They are gigantic.

18
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:18,574
A male can weigh over a tonne...

19
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:25,790
...and many die in the scrum.

20
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:42,348
On a beach, 250 miles to the west,
there's a further danger.

21
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,146
Polar bears.

22
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:02,118
They, too, have been forced to spend more
time ashore by the dwindling ice.

23
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:15,256
And now they're very hungry.

24
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:44,452
But adult walrus are tough,
well armed and agile in water,

25
00:04:44,577 --> 00:04:47,830
and could fatally injure the bear.

26
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:51,959
He's failed.

27
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:05,306
The narrow beaches here
are backed by cliffs...

28
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:13,355
...and some walrus scramble up them,
escaping the crowd.

29
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:43,219
At the top,
they are 80 metres above the beach...

30
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,643
...but this is not a place
where a walrus should be.

31
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:57,107
Nor are they the only ones
to have found it.

32
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:02,404
The bears have got up here too.

33
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,758
The walrus's instinct
is to find safety in the water.

34
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:30,599
They can still smell the sea.

35
00:06:37,982 --> 00:06:39,567
And they can hear it.

36
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:53,914
Just the polar bear's presence
is enough to spook the walrus.

37
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:14,393
Many walrus that climb the cliffs
never make it back to the ocean.

38
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:20,399
Even once the polar bears have moved on,

39
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:26,238
the walrus need to return to the sea,
and some take the nearest way to do so.

40
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:44,465
As one crashes on the rocks,

41
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:49,094
those on the beach stampede
and more lives are lost.

42
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:31,095
In the course of just a few days,
over 200 walrus die.

43
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:53,617
Now the polar bears can feed
on the carcasses.

44
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:09,341
These events only occur
once every few years,

45
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:14,012
but as the world warms
and the ice retreats still further,

46
00:09:14,138 --> 00:09:16,390
they may become more frequent.

47
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:24,773
Inland, the ground is gripped by winter

48
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,359
for six months of the year.

49
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:36,034
Two million square miles of northern
Russia are locked beneath the ice.

50
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:43,751
But even so, some creatures have
managed to make their homes here.

51
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:50,299
They leave evidence
of their presence in the snow.

52
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:57,306
These tracks all lead in one direction.

53
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:35,511
Kamchatka has the highest density
of active volcanoes on the planet.

54
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:42,017
Temperatures underground
reach 250 degrees Celsius...

55
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:47,481
...pushing up cauldrons of boiling mud
and clouds of steam...

56
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,568
...but in spite of the dangers,

57
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:56,323
some creatures travel long distances
to visit the area.

58
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,379
A Kamchatka brown bear.

59
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:16,301
He spent the long winter
sleeping in a den below ground

60
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:19,346
and now he is extremely hungry.

61
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:29,940
But finding food means getting dangerously
close to the scalding fountains.

62
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,869
This is the only place
for many miles around

63
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:47,040
where a bear can reach grass that
is snow free, thanks to the hot earth.

64
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:04,224
Putting a foot wrong here
could lead to real trouble,

65
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,476
and bodies have been found of bears

66
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:11,106
that stumbled into the pools
and were scalded to death.

67
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,948
And this bear is not alone.

68
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,545
Brown bears, by and large,
are solitary creatures

69
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,089
and this is one
of the few times of the year

70
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:38,759
when they tolerate the presence of others.

71
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:49,770
And now they are so well fed and relaxed
that they even have time to play.

72
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:18,215
This volcanic spot has become
a warm oasis in Asia's frigid north.

73
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:40,445
Away from Arctic Russia,
Asia has the hottest deserts,

74
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:45,534
highest mountains
and tallest jungles on our planet.

75
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,998
This is a continent
of incredible variety...

76
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:57,129
...but it was not always so.

77
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:01,967
Some 89 million years ago,

78
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:08,557
India was an island lying away
to the south, but it drifted northwards,

79
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:12,310
pushing up the sediments
between it and mainland Asia.

80
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:18,442
Over millions of years,

81
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:24,740
the sediments lying between crumpled up
and rose to form the Himalayas.

82
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:44,634
Now these are the tallest
mountains on the planet.

83
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:49,973
They stand over five miles high.

84
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:59,858
India is still moving northwards,
and these mountains are still rising.

85
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:12,454
Asia's mountains stretch all the way
from Afghanistan,

86
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:17,042
across northern India,
to here in central China.

87
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:26,968
These are the mountains of Shennongjia,
among China's highest.

88
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:48,490
The forests here were, until comparatively
recently, the least known in the world.

89
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:57,165
Few outsiders had any idea of
what animals might be living in them.

90
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:20,939
There were stories of human-like
monsters - yetis, abominable snowmen -

91
00:16:21,064 --> 00:16:24,192
who left strange footprints in the snow...

92
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:30,031
...but little else.

93
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:38,790
And indeed there are monkeys
living in these snowy forests,

94
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,750
and they're very strange.

95
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:49,551
Meet the blue-faced, golden-coated,

96
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:53,221
snub-nosed snow monkey.

97
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:04,191
They are among the heftiest of monkeys.

98
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:14,034
Big animals keep warm more easily
than small ones,

99
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:19,289
and they survive in colder conditions
than any other monkey on Earth.

100
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:26,129
They all have snub noses.

101
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:31,134
Perhaps prominent ones
would only too easily get frostbitten.

102
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:39,976
The whole group huddles together at
the slightest opportunity to keep warm...

103
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:47,525
...and who wouldn't?

104
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:11,758
Even adults, if they get separated
from the group, can freeze to death.

105
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:32,362
Now, in the depths of winter,
food is desperately hard to find.

106
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:41,705
The head of the family leads them
to the edge of their territory

107
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,165
in search of something to eat.

108
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:50,171
The only food here
is wretchedly unnourishing -

109
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:55,635
bark, moss and lichen.

110
00:18:57,178 --> 00:19:01,266
There's hardly enough to
sustain one monkey, let alone a family.

111
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,272
But they share it peaceably.

112
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:18,616
Survival depends on the group
keeping together.

113
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:28,084
In these mountains, any food is precious.

114
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,758
A rival group.

115
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:46,644
They, too, are searching for food.

116
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:59,491
The two males go head to head.

117
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:46,538
And now the females join the fray.

118
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:04,639
Outnumbered, the intruders retreat.

119
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:12,188
Their leader is the last to go.

120
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:27,495
The fight was over the smallest of meals,

121
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:33,209
but it was ferocious nonetheless,
and the family is now scattered...

122
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:36,963
...but they must stay together.

123
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:41,301
The youngest are already badly chilled.

124
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:52,604
She can see her father,
but has she the strength to reach him?

125
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:33,645
Back to safety and warmth.

126
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:47,992
The huddle is the only source of warmth

127
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:51,538
in these bleak, frozen forests.

128
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:20,942
To the west of the Himalayas, in Iran,
lie some of the hottest deserts on Earth.

129
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,741
This is the Lut Desert...

130
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:34,706
...and here temperatures
can reach 70 degrees Celsius.

131
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:56,269
The blisteringly hot rocks
and baking sands of Iran's deserts

132
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:59,105
may appear totally lifeless...

133
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:08,156
...but a few trees manage to grow
in the shade of the canyon walls...

134
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:15,288
...and here at least
migrating birds passing through

135
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:17,790
can stop for a little rest.

136
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:24,922
A flycatcher.

137
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:29,886
With luck, there might be
a meal of some kind here.

138
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:39,145
There are spiders in the crevices.

139
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,898
Not much, but worth having.

140
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:50,156
And there's something moving up there.

141
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,203
The bird was mistaken.

142
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:40,456
It was a viper with a lethal bite.

143
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,889
This species has only recently
been discovered

144
00:25:57,014 --> 00:26:01,519
and, so far, it has been found
nowhere else but here.

145
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:06,524
Its camouflage is so effective

146
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:10,528
that it's almost impossible to see it
on these rocks.

147
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:21,372
And on its tail, moveable scales have been
modified to look like a spider's legs...

148
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,878
...and its tip like an abdomen.

149
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:47,482
Migrating birds only appear in this barren
desert during a few weeks of the year.

150
00:26:50,902 --> 00:26:55,281
This is the snake's only chance to eat
for months.

151
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:09,796
A shrike.

152
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:15,134
It has flown here from Africa
and hasn't fed for days.

153
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:12,984
Better luck next time.

154
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:27,707
Conditions are almost as harsh
on the dry plains of northern India.

155
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:40,219
A male Sarada lizard does his best
to get himself noticed.

156
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:43,639
It's breeding time.

157
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:58,779
The wide open spaces
are a good place to be seen.

158
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:13,711
He's only 7cm tall,

159
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:18,424
but a rock will help to make him
conspicuous.

160
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:42,281
And he's already been noticed
by one female.

161
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:49,455
It's time for him to show off.

162
00:29:57,672 --> 00:30:03,803
The more healthy and virile he is,
the brighter his colours are.

163
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:15,147
And females like bright, flashy colours.

164
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:26,450
But he, it seems,
is not as conspicuous as he might be.

165
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,957
In the neighbouring territory,

166
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:37,503
there's another male
who's found an even bigger rock.

167
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:51,017
So the newcomer is not making
quite such a good impression.

168
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:57,523
The one on the big rock
is attracting all the females.

169
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:21,964
The newcomer will need a higher platform
if he's to be seen by a female,

170
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:24,592
and he'd better do something about it.

171
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:28,387
He only lives for a year.

172
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,728
This is his one chance.

173
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:44,195
He will have to fight, if necessary.

174
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:07,593
H is rival isn't backing down.

175
00:32:26,737 --> 00:32:29,782
Sarada males can fight to the death.

176
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:35,973
The newcomer has won.

177
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:51,113
Now he can claim the high platform
and the best territory...

178
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,827
...and the females will choose him
for a partner,

179
00:33:56,952 --> 00:34:00,581
as long as he can fight off
the other claimants.

180
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:20,142
As the Himalayas rose
over millions of years,

181
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:23,646
they eventually formed a gigantic barrier

182
00:34:23,771 --> 00:34:28,859
that prevented rain clouds
from the south travelling farther north...

183
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:36,450
...and a completely new weather system
developed in Southern Asia.

184
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:54,051
The monsoon.

185
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:09,149
These drenching annual rains
transformed Southern Asia.

186
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:13,153
Dense rainforests formed,

187
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:19,576
in which plants and animals of all kinds
were able to proliferate and evolve.

188
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:31,547
Some of the tallest jungles grow
in Indonesia,

189
00:35:31,672 --> 00:35:35,884
the home of the largest
of all tree-living animals of any kind...

190
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:41,056
...the orang-utan.

191
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:50,274
There is a multitude of things
to eat here,

192
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:53,569
but you have to know where to find them.

193
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:03,704
Young orangs stay with their mother
for years, learning how to do that.

194
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:07,624
This youngster has only just started.

195
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:27,061
Termites - an important source of protein.

196
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:47,122
But perhaps they are an acquired taste.

197
00:37:03,347 --> 00:37:07,643
He's off to search for something
he might prefer.

198
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:24,284
It's hard to know where to look...

199
00:37:38,549 --> 00:37:41,844
...or where it's safe to clamber.

200
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:58,318
Different levels in the forest
contain different foods,

201
00:37:58,444 --> 00:38:03,991
and some of the most delicious are
in the very highest parts of the canopy,

202
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:06,869
50 metres above the ground.

203
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:23,218
He's a couple of years old
and he's already getting adventurous.

204
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:29,057
H is mother could climb
right to the top in ten minutes or so

205
00:38:29,183 --> 00:38:34,271
if she wanted to, but she lingers,
to keep an eye on him.

206
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:42,779
A fall from this height could be fatal.

207
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:57,878
Where the gaps between the branches
are too wide for him,

208
00:38:58,003 --> 00:39:01,924
his mother lets him use her body
as a bridge.

209
00:39:18,774 --> 00:39:21,818
Only ten metres to go before the top.

210
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:34,706
But it's hard going for small hands.

211
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:49,054
He's had enough.

212
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:01,608
Time for a rest...

213
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:04,695
...with mother.

214
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:18,417
And this is his reward...

215
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:22,045
...ripe mangos, sweet and juicy.

216
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:31,722
There's so much he must learn.

217
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:43,233
He will depend entirely
on his mother until he's seven.

218
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:49,698
It's the longest of all childhoods
except ours.

219
00:40:57,998 --> 00:40:59,958
In these dense forests,

220
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:04,504
it's not easy for animals
to see one another at any distance,

221
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:08,300
but songs carry well through the jungle.

222
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:15,432
This is the characteristic sound

223
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:20,228
that echoes through the Sumatran forest
at every dawn.

224
00:41:28,362 --> 00:41:30,405
But what can this be?

225
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:37,454
Of all the sounds
in the Indonesian forests,

226
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:41,500
this is one of the strangest to our ears.

227
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:46,838
It can be heard nowhere else on Earth.

228
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:06,608
And this is the singer.

229
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:12,781
A Sumatran rhinoceros.

230
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:22,874
She's tiny, only a fifth of the size
of her more familiar African relatives.

231
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:28,463
Her head could rest comfortably
on your knee.

232
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:37,848
She is the gardener of this Eden.

233
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:46,189
She doesn't just live in it -
she helps to create and sustain it.

234
00:42:49,443 --> 00:42:53,572
She eats fruits and then sheds
the seeds in her droppings

235
00:42:53,697 --> 00:42:57,534
and so spreads the foods she prefers
through the forest.

236
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:10,130
In this dense tangle, she uses sound
to locate a possible mate.

237
00:43:18,597 --> 00:43:21,975
But her calls are unanswered.

238
00:43:23,393 --> 00:43:26,313
She is living behind a fence...

239
00:43:29,983 --> 00:43:32,277
...for her own protection.

240
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:45,207
In the past, Sumatran rhinos were
widespread throughout Southern Asia.

241
00:43:49,044 --> 00:43:52,339
Today, there are fewer than 70.

242
00:44:06,061 --> 00:44:10,732
It may well be that as she approaches
the end of her natural life,

243
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:15,695
she will have become one of the last
of her species...

244
00:44:29,209 --> 00:44:31,461
...because, in the last 40 years,

245
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:36,675
one-third of the forests of Southeast Asia
has been destroyed

246
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:41,596
in order to sell timber and food products
around the world.

247
00:44:46,977 --> 00:44:52,732
The forests of Borneo and Sumatra,
home to the orang-utan, rhinos

248
00:44:52,858 --> 00:44:58,822
and thousands of other species that have
evolved here over millions of years...

249
00:44:58,947 --> 00:45:05,537
...are now in real danger of being lost
for ever.

250
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:21,094
It seems that the animals
whose home this once was

251
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:25,807
are worth less to us
than the land they lived on.

252
00:45:29,102 --> 00:45:33,815
Viewed from space, the scale
of destruction is only too obvious.

253
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:38,945
Asia has undergone a faster change
in the last 100 years

254
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:42,741
than at any other time in its history.

255
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:50,040
Its forests are being annihilated,
its cities are expanding,

256
00:45:50,165 --> 00:45:54,044
and as the human population
approaches 4.6 billion,

257
00:45:54,169 --> 00:45:58,173
the largest of all continents
is no longer able, it seems,

258
00:45:58,298 --> 00:46:01,676
to allow space for its wildlife.

259
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:19,778
The oceans around Southern Asia
are also feeling this pressure.

260
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:30,914
These seas feed billions of people
around the world.

261
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:40,715
For many fishermen here, their catch
is their only source of livelihood.

262
00:46:46,972 --> 00:46:52,268
And there is one fish here
that they prize above all others.

263
00:47:02,612 --> 00:47:04,739
The whale shark.

264
00:47:10,412 --> 00:47:15,875
It swims slowly,
gently harvesting the plankton.

265
00:47:17,961 --> 00:47:20,547
It's almost 20 metres long -

266
00:47:20,672 --> 00:47:22,799
the largest fish in the world.

267
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:32,350
They are also under threat.

268
00:47:34,728 --> 00:47:36,771
Like many shark species in Asia,

269
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:41,901
populations have declined
by more than half in recent years.

270
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:01,504
They are an easy and valuable catch.

271
00:48:08,595 --> 00:48:14,225
But here, there is a respect
for the seas and their inhabitants.

272
00:48:17,312 --> 00:48:23,735
Whale shark hunting has now been
banned across Indonesia's waters.

273
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:31,451
This whale shark plays a different part
in the lives of these fishermen.

274
00:48:36,164 --> 00:48:42,837
They feed him, and the relationship
seems to bring joy to both parties,

275
00:48:42,962 --> 00:48:49,094
and with this new protection
has come something truly remarkable.

276
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:08,113
Whale sharks from far away
are seeking out these fishermen,

277
00:49:08,238 --> 00:49:14,744
and in these safe waters, there is
a chance for their numbers to increase.

278
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:24,921
And maybe one day
other shark species will be protected too.

279
00:49:32,262 --> 00:49:38,309
The people here have made
a simple but extraordinary choice -

280
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:44,983
fishing in a way that is sustainable
for themselves and the animals.

281
00:49:50,405 --> 00:49:55,201
Caring for wildlife
is surely our shared responsibility.

282
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:04,961
Across this vast continent and across
the world, it is decisions like these

283
00:50:05,086 --> 00:50:10,341
that are key to protecting
the planet's most precious diversity.

284
00:50:17,807 --> 00:50:22,812
Next time... a land of the unexpected.

285
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:35,533
The richest and most diverse
continent on Earth...

286
00:50:39,412 --> 00:50:41,122
...South America.
