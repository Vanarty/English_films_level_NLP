0
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,716
Dismount!

1
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:07,425
Herman's horse-sick!

2
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:17,059
Chaps, no one wander off.

3
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,300
Some of the passageways
in here can run for miles.

4
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:33,711
l don't think
this is such a good idea.

5
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,885
What is it?

6
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,642
Alfred, did you
get anything yet?

7
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:06,650
Nothing.

8
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,708
Then keep digging.

9
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:08,754
The kid's got something!

10
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:11,483
Whoo! Yee-hoo!

11
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:12,547
l got something, Garth!

12
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:15,185
l got something...
l got something right here.

13
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,291
Oh, look at that!

14
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,529
Whoo!

15
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:25,571
We're rich! We're rich!

16
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:27,435
Shut up. Shut up.

17
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:28,735
Well, we're rich, ain't we?

18
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:33,439
lndy...

19
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:34,775
lndy?

20
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:36,542
What are they doing?

21
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:39,107
lndiana? lndiana?

22
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:41,016
Shh!

23
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,350
Hey, we got to find
more stuff to bring back.

24
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,417
lt's the Cross of Coronado.

25
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:51,088
Cortez gave it to him
in 1 520.

26
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:52,791
Ah! Oh, boy! Whoo!

27
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:55,333
l'm thinkin' about
raisin' my dead mama,

28
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,835
dig down and put it on
her bony finger!

29
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,338
That cross
is an important artifact.

30
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,998
lt belongs in a museum.

31
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,633
Run back
and find the others.

32
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:07,043
Tell Mr. Havelock that there are
men looting in the caves.

33
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:08,205
Have him bring
the sheriff.

34
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,112
lt's only a snake.

35
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:11,878
Did you hear what l said?

36
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,350
Right. Run back...

37
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,751
Mr. Havelock...
the sheriff...

38
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:18,017
What, what are you
gonna do?

39
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,285
l don't know.

40
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,986
l'll think
of something.

41
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,399
Dig with your hands,

42
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:28,866
not with your mouth.

43
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,409
He's got our thing!

44
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,146
-Get him!
-Get off me!

45
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:54,156
Mr. Havelock!

46
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,159
Anybody!

47
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,355
Everybody's lost but me.

48
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,522
There he is!

49
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,156
Let's go! Let's go!

50
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,512
-Hey! Hey, you!
-Dang it!

51
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,652
Hyah! Hyah!

52
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:24,712
Hey!

53
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,782
Come back here!

54
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:40,535
Come on! Get him!

55
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:50,606
Hey, come back here!

56
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:14,032
Oh!

57
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,431
Aah... Oh!

58
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:58,441
Here, let me.

59
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,721
Oh, oh...

60
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,522
Holy smokes!

61
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,439
Come on, kid.

62
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,446
There's no way out of this.

63
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:24,135
Hey!

64
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:41,886
Toss up the whip.

65
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,824
You got heart, kid,
but that belongs to me.

66
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,162
lt belongs to Coronado.

67
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:56,496
Coronado is dead,

68
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,628
and so are all
of his grandchildren.

69
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,036
This should be in a museum.

70
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,096
Now give it back!

71
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:07,111
A snake!

72
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,111
Snake! Aah!

73
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,374
Don't let him get away!

74
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:12,642
Magic?

75
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:15,619
Hold it.

76
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:17,485
Make sure he
doesn't double back.

77
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,569
Okay, kid,
out of the box, now.

78
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,342
Son of a...

79
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,080
Damn.

80
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,600
Dad!

81
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,932
Dad!

82
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,042
Dad.

83
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,210
Dad... Out.

84
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,211
lt's important.

85
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,907
Then wait.
Count to 20.

86
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,415
No, Dad. You listen to me.

87
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:18,415
Junior!

88
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:19,917
One, two, three, four...

89
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,920
ln Greek.

90
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:37,731
''May he who illuminated this...

91
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,634
illuminate me.''

92
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,975
l brought the sheriff.

93
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,645
Just the man l want to see.

94
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:51,615
Now, there were five
or six of them...

95
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:52,708
-lt's all right, son.
-They came after me...

96
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:53,911
You still got it?

97
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,146
Well, yes, sir.

98
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:56,745
lt's right here.

99
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,483
l'm glad to see that...

100
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:01,492
because the rightful
owner of this cross

101
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,552
won't press charges
if you give it back.

102
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:08,122
He's got witnesses,
five or six of them.

103
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,276
Whoo! Yeah!

104
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,318
Good day.

105
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:40,456
You lost today, kid,

106
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:44,299
but it doesn't mean
you have to like it.

107
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:12,755
Small world, Dr. Jones.

108
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,062
Too small for two of us.

109
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:24,572
This is the second time

110
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:26,941
l've had to reclaim
my property from you.

111
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,172
That belongs in a museum.

112
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,944
So do you.

113
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,711
Throw him over the side.

114
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,000
Grab him, he's getting away!
Stop him!

115
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:20,283
Archaeology is the search

116
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,725
for fact...

117
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:26,725
...not truth.

118
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,391
lf it's truth
you're interested in,

119
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:31,095
Dr. Tyree's philosophy class
is right down the hall.

120
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,937
So forget any ideas you've got

121
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:35,665
about lost cities,
exotic travel,

122
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:36,935
and digging up the world.

123
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,805
We do not follow maps
to buried treasure,

124
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:42,370
and ''X'' never, ever,
marks the spot.

125
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,281
Seventy percent
of all archaeology is done

126
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,615
in the library.

127
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:51,656
Research. Reading.

128
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,818
We cannot afford
to take mythology

129
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,327
at face value.

130
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,225
Next week: ''Egyptology.''

131
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,597
Starting with the excavation
of Naukratis

132
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,192
by Flinders Petrie in 1 885.

133
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,294
l will be in my office

134
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:06,736
if anybody's got
any problems,

135
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:08,136
for the next hour
and a half.

136
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,746
Marcus, l did it.

137
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:19,045
You've got it!

138
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,590
Oh!

139
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,856
You know how long l've
been looking for that?

140
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,659
All your life.

141
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,221
All my life.

142
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,392
Well done, lndy.

143
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:37,128
Very well done, indeed.

144
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:40,933
This will find a place of honor
in our Spanish collection.

145
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:42,938
We can discuss
my honorarium

146
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,340
over dinner and
champagne tonight.

147
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:46,571
Your treat.

148
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:47,942
Yes.

149
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:50,174
My treat.

150
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,513
Dr. Jones!
Dr. Jones!

151
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,958
Shush! Shush! Shush!

152
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,789
Dr. Jones, l am so glad
you're back.

153
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,158
Your mail is on your desk.

154
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,628
Here are your
phone messages.

155
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,222
Dr. Jones, you promised...

156
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,664
This is your
appointment schedule,

157
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:10,759
and these term papers still
haven't been graded.

158
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:12,667
Okay. lrene,
put everybody's name on a list,

159
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:13,898
get the order they arrived...

160
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,132
Oh, come on, Dr. Jones.

161
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,299
Dr. Jones.

162
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,900
...and l'll see each
and every one of them...

163
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,445
in turn.

164
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,392
''Venice, ltaly.''

165
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:04,853
Dr. Jones!

166
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,163
Dr. Jones?

167
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,177
l trust your trip down
was comfortable, Dr. Jones.

168
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,219
Uh, my men didn't alarm you,
l hope.

169
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:36,220
My name is Donovan.

170
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:37,380
Walter Donovan.

171
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:38,684
l know who you are,
Mr. Donovan.

172
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,054
Your contributions
to the museum

173
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,922
over the years have
been extremely generous.

174
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,153
Some of the pieces

175
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,059
in your collection here
are very impressive.

176
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,859
Well, like yourself,
Dr. Jones,

177
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:48,729
l have a passion
for antiquities.

178
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:50,769
Have a look over here.

179
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:55,273
This might interest you.

180
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,277
Well, it's sandstone.

181
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:00,936
Christian symbol.

182
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:02,877
Early Latin text.

183
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:05,449
Mid-1 2th century,
l should think.

184
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,451
That was our
assessment, as well.

185
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,884
Where did this come from?

186
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:10,251
My engineers
unearthed it

187
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,381
in the mountain region
north of Ankara

188
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,891
while excavating
for copper.

189
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:15,926
Can you translate
the inscription?

190
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:22,734
''...who drinks the water
l shall give him, says the Lord,

191
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:26,066
''will have a... spring

192
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:29,630
''inside him welling up
for eternal life.

193
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,208
''Let them bring me
to your holy mountain

194
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,042
''in the place where you dwell.

195
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,207
''Across the desert

196
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,307
''and through the mountain

197
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:41,409
''to the Canyon
of the Crescent Moon,

198
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,581
to the temple
where the cup that... ''

199
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:50,257
''Where the cup
that holds the blood

200
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:54,197
of Jesus Christ resides
forever.''

201
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:57,929
The Holy Grail, Dr. Jones.

202
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:01,996
The chalice used by Christ
during the Last Supper.

203
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:05,305
The cup that caught His blood
at the Crucifixion

204
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:09,074
and was entrusted to
Joseph of Arimathea.

205
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,082
The Arthur legend.

206
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,880
l've heard this
bedtime story before.

207
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:15,281
Eternal life, Dr. Jones!

208
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:17,686
The gift of youth to whoever
drinks from the Grail.

209
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,416
Now, that's a bedtime story
l'd like to wake up to.

210
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,517
An old man's dream.

211
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:24,289
Every man's dream,

212
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,388
including your
father's, l believe.

213
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,469
Grail lore is his hobby.

214
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,528
He's a teacher
of medieval literature.

215
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:35,800
The one the students hope
they don't get.

216
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:38,900
Walter, you're neglecting
your guests.

217
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:41,537
Be along in a moment, dear.

218
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:48,779
Hard to resist, isn't it?

219
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,221
The Holy Grail's final resting
place described in detail.

220
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,384
What good is it?

221
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:56,450
This grail tablet
speaks of deserts

222
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,155
and mountains and canyons.

223
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,322
lt's pretty vague.

224
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,332
Where do you want
to start looking?

225
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,164
Maybe if the tablet were intact,
you'd have something to go on,

226
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,863
but the entire top portion
is missing.

227
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:06,927
Just the same, an attempt

228
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,939
to recover the Grail
is currently underway.

229
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:15,071
Let me tell you another
bedtime story, Dr. Jones.

230
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:18,048
After the Grail was entrusted
to Joseph of Arimathea,

231
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,676
it disappeared, and was lost
for a thousand years

232
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:22,083
before it was found again

233
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,145
by three knights
of the First Crusade.

234
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,747
Three brothers, to be exact.

235
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:27,792
l've heard this one, as well.

236
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:31,659
Two of these brothers walked
out of the desert 1 50 years

237
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,630
after having found the Grail

238
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:36,600
and began the long journey
back to France,

239
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:38,693
but only one of them made it.

240
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,238
And before dying
of extreme old age,

241
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:43,467
he supposedly imparted
his tale

242
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:46,238
to a... to a Franciscan friar,
l think.

243
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:49,439
Not ''supposedly,''
Dr. Jones.

244
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:50,845
This is the manuscript

245
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,908
in which the friar chronicled
the knight's story.

246
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,510
lt doesn't reveal

247
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,179
the location of the Grail,
l'm afraid,

248
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,314
but the knight promised

249
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,688
that two markers, that had been
left behind, would.

250
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,626
This tablet is one
of those markers.

251
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:06,687
lt proves
the knight's story is true.

252
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,824
But as you pointed out,
it's incomplete.

253
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,663
Now, the second marker
is entombed

254
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,397
with the knight's dead brother.

255
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,063
Our project leader

256
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:16,130
believes that tomb to be located

257
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,233
within the city
of Venice, ltaly.

258
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,803
As you can now see,
Dr. Jones,

259
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:25,941
we're about
to complete a great quest

260
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:28,951
that began almost
2,000 years ago.

261
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,487
We're only one step away.

262
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,955
That's usually
when the ground falls out

263
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:34,685
from underneath your feet.

264
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,388
You could be more right
than you know.

265
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,759
Yes?

266
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,162
We've hit a snag.

267
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,793
Our project leader has vanished,

268
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,962
along with all his research.

269
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,333
Uh, we received a cable

270
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,237
from his colleague,
Dr. Schneider,

271
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,173
who has no idea
of his whereabouts

272
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:52,574
or what's become of him.

273
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:56,205
l want you to pick up the trail
where he left off.

274
00:21:56,281 --> 00:22:00,684
Find the man,
and you will find the Grail.

275
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:03,186
You've got
the wrong Jones,

276
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:04,586
Mr. Donovan.

277
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,925
Why don't you try my father?

278
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,927
We already have.

279
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,486
Your father is the man
who has disappeared.

280
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:26,133
Your father and l have been
friends since time began.

281
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:27,473
l've watched you grow up, lndy.

282
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:29,138
l've watched
the two of you grow apart.

283
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:31,375
l've never seen you this
concerned about him before.

284
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,714
Dad?

285
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:34,945
He's an academic;
a bookworm.

286
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:36,145
He's not a field man.

287
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:38,155
Dad? Dad?

288
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:40,453
Dear God.

289
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:45,755
What has the old fool
got himself into now?

290
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,765
l don't know,

291
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,427
but whatever it is,
he's in over his head.

292
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,436
Dad?

293
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:54,199
lt's today's mail,

294
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:56,467
and it's been opened.

295
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,476
Mail.

296
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,512
That's it, Marcus.

297
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:05,506
Venice, ltaly.

298
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,447
What is it?

299
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:14,959
lt's Dad's Grail diary.

300
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,355
Every clue he followed.

301
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,829
Every discovery he made.

302
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,958
A complete record of his search
for the Holy Grail.

303
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:26,562
This is his whole life.

304
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:28,833
Why would he have
sent this to me?

305
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,704
l don't know,

306
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:34,542
but someone must want it
pretty badly.

307
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:45,582
Do you believe, Marcus?

308
00:23:57,402 --> 00:24:01,202
Do you believe
the Grail actually exists?

309
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,571
The search for the Cup of Christ

310
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:06,668
is the search for the divine
in all of us.

311
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:08,372
But if you want facts, lndy,

312
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,846
l've none to give you.

313
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:11,473
At my age, l'm prepared

314
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,643
to take a few
things on faith.

315
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:21,425
Call Donovan, Marcus.

316
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,552
Tell him l'll take
that ticket to Venice now.

317
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,261
l'll tell him
we'll take two.

318
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:35,806
All right, tell me what's going
to happen when we get to Venice.

319
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:38,138
Don't worry, Dr. Schneider
will be there to meet you.

320
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,472
-Uh, Schneider?
-l maintain

321
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:41,205
an apartment in Venice.
lt's at your disposal.

322
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,371
Oh, well, that's good.

323
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:44,415
Thank you.

324
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,384
Dr. Jones... good luck.

325
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:49,215
Now be very careful.

326
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:51,380
Don't trust anybody.

327
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,082
Signora?

328
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:28,284
Signorina?

329
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:36,266
Ah, Venice...

330
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:37,562
Yes.

331
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:40,104
Uh, how will we recognize
this Dr. Schneider

332
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:41,331
when we see him?

333
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:43,340
l don't know.

334
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:44,705
Maybe he'll know us.

335
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:47,609
Dr. Jones?

336
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:48,771
Yes?

337
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:51,042
l knew it was you.

338
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:54,108
You have your father's eyes.

339
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,520
And my mother's ears,
but the rest belongs to you.

340
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:02,719
Looks like the best parts have
already been spoken for.

341
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:04,352
Marcus Brody?

342
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:06,056
That's right.

343
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:07,428
Dr. Elsa Schneider.

344
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:08,727
Oh, how do you do?

345
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,894
The last time l saw your father,
we were in the library.

346
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:12,901
He was very close

347
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,006
to tracking down
the knight's tomb.

348
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,870
l've never seen him so excited.

349
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:18,739
He was as giddy as a schoolboy.

350
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,744
Who? Attila
the Professor?

351
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:22,245
He was never giddy,

352
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,509
even when he was
a schoolboy.

353
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,643
Fraulein, will
you permit me?

354
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:28,811
l usually don't.

355
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:30,218
l usually
don't, either.

356
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:31,414
ln that case,
l permit you.

357
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:32,615
lt would make
me very happy.

358
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:33,623
But l'm already sad.

359
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:35,023
By tomorrow,
it will have faded.

360
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,424
Tomorrow l'll
steal you another.

361
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:37,791
l hate to interrupt you,

362
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:39,090
but the reason
we're here...

363
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:40,597
Yes. l have something
to show you.

364
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:42,496
l left your father working
in the library.

365
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:43,829
He sent me to the map section

366
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:45,494
to fetch an ancient plan
of the city.

367
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,765
When l got back to his table,
he'd gone, with all his papers,

368
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:50,034
except for that scrap,
which l found near his chair.

369
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,076
Roman numerals.

370
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:54,168
Here is the library.

371
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:56,736
That doesn't look much
like a library.

372
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,511
Looks like a
converted church.

373
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:01,518
ln this case,
it's the literal truth.

374
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:03,451
We are on holy ground.

375
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:04,988
These columns over here

376
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:07,183
were brought back
as spoils of war

377
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:10,523
after the sacking of Byzantium
during the Crusades.

378
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:12,062
Now, please excuse me.

379
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,758
The library's closing
in a few moments.

380
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:17,700
l'll arrange for us
to stay a little longer.

381
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:24,173
Marcus... l've seen
this window before.

382
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:25,675
Where?

383
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:28,269
Right here,
in Dad's diary.

384
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:37,247
You see?

385
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,846
Look, lndy.

386
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:40,914
The Roman numerals.

387
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,324
Dad was onto something here.

388
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:45,295
Well, now we know
the source of the numbers,

389
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:47,092
but we still don't know
what they mean.

390
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,326
Dad sent me this
diary for a reason.

391
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:50,493
Until we find
out why,

392
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:51,933
l suggest we keep
it to ourselves.

393
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:53,129
Find something?

394
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:54,762
Uh, yes.
Three, seven and ten.

395
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,670
That window seems
to be the source

396
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:57,935
of the Roman numerals.

397
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,408
My God,
l must be blind.

398
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:02,344
Dad wasn't looking for a book
about the knight's tomb,

399
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,279
he was looking
for the tomb itself.

400
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,782
Don't you get it?

401
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,579
The tomb is somewhere
in the library.

402
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:09,586
You said yourself
it used to be a church.

403
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:10,882
Look.

404
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:13,253
Three.

405
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,494
Three.

406
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:17,721
Seven.

407
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,356
Seven. Ten.

408
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:22,367
And ten.

409
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,994
Now where's the ten?

410
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,630
Look around for the ten.

411
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,807
Three and seven.

412
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,851
Seven and seven

413
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,285
and ten.

414
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,565
Ten.

415
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:08,305
''X'' marks the spot.

416
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:06,859
Bingo.

417
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:08,530
You don't disappoint,
Dr. Jones.

418
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:10,233
You're a great deal
like your father.

419
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,935
Except he's lost,
and l'm not.

420
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:13,135
Lower me down.

421
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:25,345
Look after this for me,
will you?

422
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,729
Come on.

423
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,870
Pagan symbols.

424
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:51,245
Fourth or fifth century.

425
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:52,408
Right.

426
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:55,247
600 years before
the Crusades.

427
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,686
The Christians would have
dug their own passages

428
00:30:57,755 --> 00:30:59,518
and burial chambers
centuries later.

429
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:01,081
That's right.

430
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,423
lf there's a knight of
the First Crusade down here,

431
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,462
that's where we'll find him.

432
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:38,520
What's this one?

433
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:40,621
The Ark of the Covenant.

434
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:41,756
Are you sure?

435
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,232
Pretty sure.

436
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,251
Watch out.

437
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:19,163
lt's petroleum.

438
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:22,001
l should sink
a well down here and retire.

439
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:40,022
Give me the lighter.

440
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:51,793
Oh, rats.

441
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:52,893
Ugh!

442
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:09,481
Come on.

443
00:33:58,169 --> 00:33:59,466
Come here.

444
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:09,509
Look, it...

445
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,672
it must be one of these.

446
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:11,908
Look at the artistry

447
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:15,577
of these carvings,
and the scrollwork.

448
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:33,134
lt's this one.

449
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,947
This is it.

450
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:51,419
We found it.

451
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:54,849
Look.

452
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:58,485
The engraving on the shield,

453
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:01,657
it's the same
as on the Grail tablet.

454
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:04,998
The shield is the second marker.

455
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:06,559
What's that?

456
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:08,571
lt's a rubbing

457
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:11,574
Dad made
of the Grail tablet.

458
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:14,202
Just like your father--
giddy as a schoolboy.

459
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:16,837
Wouldn't it be wonderful

460
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:18,973
if he were here now
to see this?

461
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:22,678
He never would have
made it past the rats.

462
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:23,913
He hates rats.

463
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:26,319
He's scared to death of them.

464
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:48,710
Get back!

465
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:50,337
Back against the wall.

466
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:55,915
Quick! Under it!

467
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,352
Air pocket!

468
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,427
Don't wander off.

469
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:05,519
What?

470
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:06,824
What?!

471
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,411
l think l've found
a way out.

472
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:28,952
Deep breath.

473
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,431
Ah, Venice.

474
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:21,735
Whoa!

475
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,664
Are you crazy?!
Don't go between them!

476
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:59,642
Go between them?
Are you crazy?!

477
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:12,044
l said go around!

478
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,886
You said
go between them!

479
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:16,152
l said,
don't go between them!

480
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:20,385
No!

481
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:27,688
Why are you
trying to kill us?

482
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:29,323
Because you're looking
for the Holy Grail.

483
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,630
My father was looking
for the Holy Grail.

484
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:32,828
Did you kill him too?

485
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:33,835
No.

486
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:35,633
Where is he?

487
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:38,174
Talk or you're dead.

488
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:39,834
Damn it, tell me!

489
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,138
Tell me!

490
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,840
lf you don't let go, Dr. Jones,
we'll both die.

491
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:45,905
Then we'll die.

492
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,019
My soul is prepared.
How's yours?

493
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:52,246
This is your last chance.

494
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:55,315
No, Dr. Jones, it's yours.

495
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:13,708
All right, where's my father?

496
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:16,542
lf you let me go,
l will tell you where he is.

497
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:18,479
Who are you?

498
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:20,483
My name is Kazim.

499
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:22,041
And why were you
trying to kill me?

500
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:23,848
The secret of the Grail

501
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,253
has been safe
for a thousand years,

502
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:28,223
and for all that time,

503
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:30,760
the Brotherhood of
the Cruciform Sword

504
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:35,629
have been prepared
to do anything to keep it safe.

505
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:38,901
Let me off
at this jetty.

506
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:46,408
Ask yourself, why do you
seek the Cup of Christ?

507
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:49,810
ls it for His glory,
or for yours?

508
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,508
l didn't come
for the Cup of Christ.

509
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:54,483
l came to find my father.

510
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:57,953
ln that case,
God be with you in your quest.

511
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:00,889
Your father is being held
in the Castle of Brunwald,

512
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,324
on the Austrian-German border.

513
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:13,434
How's the head?

514
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:16,234
lt's better,
now l've seen this.

515
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,571
lt's the name of a city.

516
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,200
''Alexandretta''?

517
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,878
Hmm...

518
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:24,812
The knights of the First Crusade

519
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:28,079
laid siege to the city
of Alexandretta for over a year.

520
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,780
The entire city was destroyed.

521
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:36,487
The present city of lskenderun
is built on its ruins.

522
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:40,693
Marcus, you remember
what the Grail tablet said:

523
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:43,232
''Across the desert
and through the mountain

524
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,427
to the Canyon
of the Crescent Moon.''

525
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:50,599
But where exactly?

526
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,335
Your father would know.

527
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:53,341
Mm.

528
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,844
Your father did know.

529
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:57,437
Look. He made a map.

530
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,278
He must have
pieced it together

531
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,681
from clues
scattered through

532
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:02,548
the whole history
of the Grail quest.

533
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,746
A map with no names.

534
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:05,482
Now, he knew there
was a city

535
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:07,251
with an oasis
due east, here.

536
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:08,313
He knew the course

537
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:10,189
turned south through
the desert to a river,

538
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:12,092
and the river led
into the mountains, here.

539
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:13,629
Straight to the canyon.

540
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:16,165
He knew everything
except where to begin,

541
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:17,860
the name of the city.

542
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:21,395
Alexandretta.

543
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:22,461
Now we know.

544
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,939
Yes. Now we know.

545
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:25,439
Marcus, get hold of Sallah.

546
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:26,908
Tell him to meet you
in lskenderun.

547
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:27,944
What about you?

548
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:29,411
l'm going after Dad.

549
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:52,769
Elsa?

550
00:42:57,942 --> 00:43:00,877
Elsa? Elsa?

551
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:02,742
Oh! Oh...

552
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,385
My room...

553
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:14,219
Mine, too.

554
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:16,054
What were they
looking for?

555
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:17,593
This.

556
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:19,151
The Grail diary?

557
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:20,753
Uh-huh.

558
00:43:20,831 --> 00:43:22,628
You had it?

559
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,531
You didn't trust me.

560
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,593
l didn't know you.

561
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:29,537
At least l let you tag along.

562
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:30,801
Oh, yes.

563
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:33,707
Give them a flower,
and they'll follow you anywhere.

564
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:37,103
Knock it off. You're not mad.

565
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:38,648
No?

566
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:40,946
No. You like
the way l do things.

567
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:44,077
lt's lucky l don't do
things the same way.

568
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:46,782
You'd still be standing
at the Venice pier!

569
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:49,382
Look, what do you think
is going on here?

570
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,486
Since l met you,
l've nearly been incinerated,

571
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:55,361
drowned, shot at,
and chopped into fish bait.

572
00:43:55,432 --> 00:43:57,957
We're caught in the middle
of something sinister here.

573
00:43:58,035 --> 00:44:00,663
My guess is Dad found out
more than he was looking for.

574
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:01,670
And until l'm sure,

575
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:03,297
l'm going to
continue to do things

576
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:05,171
the way l think
they should be done.

577
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:11,809
How dare you kiss me!

578
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:20,520
Leave me alone.
l don't like fast women.

579
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:22,058
And l hate...

580
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:25,527
arrogant men.

581
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:36,496
Ah, Venice.

582
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:10,904
What do you know
about this place?

583
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:14,409
l know the Brunwalds
are famous art collectors.

584
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:17,740
What are you going to do?

585
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:18,907
Don't know.

586
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:20,279
l'll think of something.

587
00:45:28,192 --> 00:45:29,523
Yes?

588
00:45:29,593 --> 00:45:31,254
And not before time!

589
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:32,386
Did you intend to leave us

590
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:33,794
standing on
the doorstep all day?

591
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:34,831
We're drenched!

592
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,694
Now look, l've gone
and caught a sniffle.

593
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:39,861
Are you expected?

594
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:42,269
Do not take that tone
with me, my good man.

595
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:44,364
Now buttle off
and tell Baron Brunwald

596
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:47,569
that Lord Clarence MacDonald
and his lovely assistant...

597
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:51,176
...are here to view
the tapestries.

598
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,306
Tapestries?

599
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:54,077
Dear me,
the man is dense.

600
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:55,948
This is a castle,
isn't it?

601
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:57,452
There are tapestries?

602
00:45:57,521 --> 00:45:59,614
This is a castle,

603
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:02,284
and we have
many tapestries.

604
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:04,827
But if you are
a Scottish lord,

605
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:07,830
then l am Mickey Mouse!

606
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:09,991
How dare he?

607
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:39,392
Nazis. l hate these guys.

608
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:54,403
This one. l think
he's in here.

609
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:55,604
How do you know?

610
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:57,772
Because it's wired.

611
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:28,144
lndy? lndy?

612
00:47:28,212 --> 00:47:31,045
Don't worry...
this is kid's play.

613
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:32,775
l'll be right back.

614
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:58,302
Junior?

615
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,673
Yes, sir.

616
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:02,075
lt is you, Junior!

617
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:04,238
Don't call me that,
please.

618
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:06,646
Well, what are you
doing here?

619
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,344
l came to get you.
What do you thi...?

620
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:21,621
Late 1 4th century,
Ming dynasty.

621
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:24,064
Oh, it breaks the heart.

622
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:26,728
And the head.
You hit me, Dad.

623
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:29,101
l'll never forgive myself.

624
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:31,572
Don't worry, l'm fine.

625
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:33,837
Thank God.

626
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:39,805
lt's fake.

627
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:44,217
See, you can tell
by the cross section.

628
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:45,383
No!

629
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:46,581
Dad, get your stuff.

630
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:48,284
We've got to get
out of here.

631
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:50,656
Well, l'm sorry about
your head, though,

632
00:48:50,727 --> 00:48:52,752
but l thought you
were one of them.

633
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:55,320
Dad, they come in
through the doors.

634
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:57,390
Good point.

635
00:48:57,467 --> 00:48:59,867
But better safe
than sorry.

636
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,802
Hmm, so l was wrong this time.

637
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:05,308
But, by God, l wasn't wrong
when l mailed you my diary.

638
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:06,672
You obviously got it.

639
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:11,172
l got it, and l used it.

640
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:14,684
We found the entrance
to the catacombs.

641
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,218
Through the library?

642
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:18,186
Right.

643
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:23,249
l knew it.

644
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:24,885
And the tomb of Sir Richard?

645
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:27,590
Found it.

646
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:30,929
He was actually there?

647
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,395
You saw him?

648
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:37,440
Well, what was
left of him.

649
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:39,372
And his shield...

650
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:43,880
the inscription on
Sir Richard's shield?

651
00:49:43,947 --> 00:49:45,915
''Alexandretta.''

652
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:48,280
Alexandretta! Of course!

653
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:52,584
On the pilgrim trail
from the Eastern Empire.

654
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:53,623
Oh...

655
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:57,592
Junior, you did it.

656
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,925
No, Dad. You did.

657
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,624
Forty years.

658
00:50:01,698 --> 00:50:04,826
Oh, if only l could have been
with you.

659
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:06,732
There were rats,
Dad.

660
00:50:06,803 --> 00:50:08,100
Rats?

661
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,433
Yeah, big ones.

662
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:12,100
What do the Nazis
want with you, Dad?

663
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:13,335
They wanted my diary.

664
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:14,741
Yeah?

665
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:18,212
l knew l had to get that book
as far away from me

666
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:19,714
as l possibly could.

667
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:23,644
Yeah.

668
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:29,552
Dr. Jones.

669
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:30,923
Yes?

670
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:35,728
l will take the book now.

671
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:39,257
What book?

672
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:41,736
You have the diary
in your pocket.

673
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:45,400
You dolt!

674
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:47,409
Do you think my son
would be that stupid

675
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:49,445
that he would
bring my diary

676
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:51,105
all the way back here?

677
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:53,809
You didn't, did you?

678
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:56,250
You didn't bring it,
did you?

679
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:57,251
Well, uh...

680
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,151
You did.

681
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:01,190
Look, can we
discuss this later?

682
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:03,249
l should have mailed it
to the Marx Brothers.

683
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:05,260
Will you take it easy?

684
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:06,625
Take it easy?!

685
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:07,685
Why do you think
l sent it home

686
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:08,696
in the first place?

687
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:10,198
So it wouldn't fall
into their hands!

688
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:12,360
l came here
to save you!

689
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:13,368
Oh, yeah?

690
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:16,133
And who's gonna come
to save you, Junior?

691
00:51:16,206 --> 00:51:17,264
l told you...

692
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,681
...don't call me Junior!

693
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:30,945
Look what you did!

694
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:35,016
l can't believe what you did...

695
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:39,461
Elsa? Elsa?

696
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:42,123
That's far enough.
Put down the gun, Dr. Jones.

697
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:43,461
Put down the gun,
or the fraulein dies.

698
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:44,465
But she's one of them.

699
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:45,831
lndy, please!

700
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:46,834
She's a Nazi.

701
00:51:46,903 --> 00:51:47,835
What?!

702
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:48,529
Trust me.

703
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:50,300
-lndy, no!
-l will kill her!

704
00:51:50,373 --> 00:51:51,704
Yeah? Go ahead!

705
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:52,969
No! Don't shoot!

706
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:55,204
Don't worry. He won't.

707
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:57,303
lndy, please! Do what he says!

708
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:59,871
And don't listen to her.

709
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,815
Enough! She dies!

710
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:05,252
Wait! Wait...

711
00:52:10,594 --> 00:52:12,528
l'm sorry.

712
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:16,657
No, don't be.

713
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:32,042
But... you should have
listened to your father.

714
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,232
She ransacked her own room,

715
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:53,098
and l fell for it.

716
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,367
How did you know
she was a Nazi?

717
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:57,371
Hmm?

718
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,432
How did you know
she was a Nazi?

719
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,138
She talks in her sleep.

720
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:15,386
l didn't trust her.
Why did you?

721
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:18,052
Because he didn't
take my advice.

722
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,801
Donovan.

723
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,167
Didn't l warn you

724
00:53:28,238 --> 00:53:30,672
not to trust anybody,
Dr. Jones?

725
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,674
l misjudged you, Walter.

726
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:36,200
l knew you would sell your
mother for an Etruscan vase,

727
00:53:36,279 --> 00:53:38,270
but l didn't know
you would sell

728
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:39,940
your country
and your soul

729
00:53:40,016 --> 00:53:41,950
to the slime
of humanity.

730
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:45,613
Dr. Schneider...

731
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:47,884
there are pages
torn out of this.

732
00:53:56,266 --> 00:53:59,235
This book contained a map,
a map with no names,

733
00:53:59,302 --> 00:54:01,827
precise directions
from the unknown city

734
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:04,567
to the secret Canyon
of the Crescent Moon.

735
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:05,903
So it did.

736
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:07,841
Where are these missing pages,
this map?

737
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,845
We must have
these pages back.

738
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,175
You're wasting
your breath.

739
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:12,442
He won't tell us,

740
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:14,813
and he doesn't have to.

741
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:18,820
lt's perfectly obvious
where the pages are.

742
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:20,913
He's given them
to Marcus Brody.

743
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:21,922
Marcus?

744
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:24,356
You didn't drag poor
Marcus along, did you?

745
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:25,917
He's not up
to the challenge.

746
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:27,929
He sticks out
like a sore thumb.

747
00:54:28,064 --> 00:54:29,292
We'll find him.

748
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:30,526
The hell you will.

749
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,295
He's got a two-day
head start on you,

750
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:33,666
which is more
than he needs.

751
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:36,069
Brody's got friends
in every town and village

752
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:37,367
from here to the Sudan.

753
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,307
He speaks a dozen languages,
knows every local custom.

754
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:41,867
He'll blend in, disappear.

755
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,503
You'll never see him again.

756
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:47,482
With any luck,
he's got the Grail already.

757
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:49,642
Does anyone here
speak English?

758
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:50,708
Or even ancient Greek?

759
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,220
Uh, water?
No, thank you, sir.

760
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,654
No. Fish make love in it.

761
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:54,917
Goodness me.

762
00:54:54,991 --> 00:54:55,923
Thank you so much.

763
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:56,959
No, l don't like that.

764
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,118
No, l really don't want...

765
00:54:58,194 --> 00:54:59,786
No, no, thank you very much.

766
00:54:59,863 --> 00:55:02,559
No, thank you, madam.
l'm a vegetarian.

767
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:05,897
Does anyone understand
a word l'm saying here?

768
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,129
Mr. Brody!

769
00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:08,727
Oh, Sallah.
What a relief.

770
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:10,898
Marcus Brody, sir.

771
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:12,008
But where is lndy?

772
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:13,042
Oh, he's in Austria.

773
00:55:13,109 --> 00:55:14,076
A slight detour.

774
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,475
You are on your own?

775
00:55:15,545 --> 00:55:16,671
Yes, but don't panic.

776
00:55:16,746 --> 00:55:18,270
Everything's under control.

777
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:20,441
Have you, have you
arranged our supplies?

778
00:55:20,517 --> 00:55:21,449
Oh, yes,
of course.

779
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:22,644
But where
are we going?

780
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:23,913
Oh, this map will show you.

781
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:25,817
lt was drawn by, uh...

782
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:27,857
Mr. Brody.

783
00:55:27,924 --> 00:55:29,915
Welcome to lskenderun.

784
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:31,927
The director
of the Museum of Antiquities

785
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:33,222
has sent a car for you.

786
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:35,560
Oh, well...
your servant, sir.

787
00:55:35,632 --> 00:55:36,929
And l am his.

788
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:39,058
Follow me, please.

789
00:55:39,135 --> 00:55:41,126
My reputation precedes me.

790
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:42,933
There is no museum
in lskenderun.

791
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:44,540
Papers, please.

792
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:45,574
Papers?

793
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:46,666
Of course.

794
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:47,801
Run.

795
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:48,809
Yes.

796
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:50,311
Papers. Got it here.

797
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:51,938
Just finished
reading it myself.

798
00:55:52,082 --> 00:55:53,049
Run.

799
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:54,048
Yes.

800
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:55,778
''Egyptian Mail,''
morning edition.

801
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:56,819
Run.

802
00:55:56,886 --> 00:55:57,818
Did you say, uh...

803
00:55:57,887 --> 00:55:58,512
Run!

804
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:15,828
Okay, okay,
quick, quick, quick!

805
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:17,736
Find the back door!
Find the back door!

806
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:33,854
lntolerable.

807
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,724
Dr. Schneider.
Message from Berlin.

808
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:40,353
You must return immediately.

809
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:42,489
A rally at the lnstitute
of Aryan Culture.

810
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:43,554
So?

811
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:44,895
Your presence
on the platform

812
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:47,300
is requested
at the highest level.

813
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:48,928
Thank you, Herr Oberst.

814
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,562
l will meet you
at lskenderun.

815
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:51,572
Take this diary

816
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:52,835
to the Reichmuseum
in Berlin.

817
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,206
lt will show them
our progress,

818
00:56:54,277 --> 00:56:55,209
ahead of schedule.

819
00:56:55,278 --> 00:56:56,245
Without the map,

820
00:56:56,312 --> 00:56:57,870
l'm afraid it's no
better than a souvenir.

821
00:56:57,947 --> 00:56:59,107
Let me kill them now.

822
00:56:59,182 --> 00:57:00,149
No.

823
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:02,480
lf we fail to recover
the pages from Brody,

824
00:57:02,552 --> 00:57:03,746
we'll need them alive.

825
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:06,186
Always do what
the doctor orders.

826
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:15,854
Don't look at me like that.

827
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:18,025
We both wanted the Grail.

828
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:21,093
l would have done
anything to get it.

829
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:22,399
You would have
done the same.

830
00:57:22,472 --> 00:57:24,963
l'm sorry you think so.

831
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:38,651
l can't forget
how wonderful it was.

832
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:40,188
Thank you.

833
00:57:40,256 --> 00:57:42,281
lt was rather wonderful.

834
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:53,594
Oh, Dr. Schneider.

835
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:56,662
Your car is waiting.

836
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:06,914
That's how Austrians
say good-bye.

837
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:16,790
And this is how we say good-bye
in Germany, Dr. Jones.

838
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:19,795
Oh!

839
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:27,059
l liked the Austrian way
better.

840
00:58:27,136 --> 00:58:28,763
So did l.

841
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:30,703
Let's try and get
these ropes loose.

842
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:33,298
We've got to get to Marcus
before the Nazis do.

843
00:58:33,376 --> 00:58:35,537
You said he had
two days' start.

844
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:37,477
That he would blend in.
Disappear.

845
00:58:37,547 --> 00:58:39,242
Are you kidding?
l made that up.

846
00:58:39,315 --> 00:58:40,247
You know Marcus.

847
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:41,874
He got lost once
in his own museum.

848
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:43,077
Oh...

849
00:58:43,152 --> 00:58:47,111
Can you try and reach
my left jacket pocket?

850
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:49,922
What am l looking for?

851
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:51,517
My lucky charm.

852
00:58:53,062 --> 00:58:54,654
Feels like
a cigarette lighter.

853
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:57,526
Try and burn
through the ropes.

854
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,569
Very good.

855
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:05,999
Oh!

856
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:26,489
l ought to tell you something.

857
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:27,825
Don't get
sentimental now Dad.

858
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:29,296
Save it till
we get out of here.

859
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:31,094
The floor's on fire.

860
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:32,828
-See?
-What?

861
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:34,563
And the chair.

862
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:36,002
Move! Move it out of here!

863
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,096
Go!

864
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:39,073
lt's scorching the table!
Fast!

865
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:40,109
-Move!
-Okay!

866
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:56,082
Well, we have Marcus Brody,

867
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:59,094
but more important,
we have the map.

868
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:05,296
''By the personal command
of the Fuhrer.

869
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:06,926
''Secrecy essential to success.

870
01:00:07,003 --> 01:00:09,699
Eliminate the American
conspirators.''

871
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:13,572
Germany has declared war
on the Jones boys.

872
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:20,180
-Dad!
-What?

873
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:21,181
Dad!

874
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:22,182
What?

875
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:23,183
-Dad!
-What?

876
01:00:23,252 --> 01:00:24,446
Head for the fireplace!

877
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:25,509
Oh.

878
01:00:37,533 --> 01:00:39,592
l think l can get
these ropes off.

879
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:41,792
Whoops.

880
01:00:52,515 --> 01:00:55,643
Our situation has not improved.

881
01:00:55,718 --> 01:00:57,618
Listen, Dad, l'm almost free.

882
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:14,100
Alarm!

883
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:24,806
This is intolerable.

884
01:01:26,049 --> 01:01:27,346
l'm out, Dad.

885
01:01:27,417 --> 01:01:29,442
Well done, boy.

886
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,453
Come on, Dad.

887
01:02:12,795 --> 01:02:14,422
Dead end.

888
01:02:14,497 --> 01:02:16,055
There's got to be a...

889
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:17,929
a secret door or a...

890
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:20,501
passageway
or something.

891
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:23,835
l find that if l just
sit down and think...

892
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:28,068
Dad!

893
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:34,279
...the solution presents itself.

894
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:44,455
Great. More boats.

895
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:48,759
You say this has been

896
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:51,231
just another typical
day for you, huh?

897
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:56,097
No! But better than most.

898
01:02:58,474 --> 01:03:00,408
Come on, Dad. Come on.

899
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:01,807
What about the boat?

900
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:03,903
We're not going on the boat?

901
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:20,050
Jones!

902
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:33,866
Halt! Halt!

903
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:38,030
-Stop!
-What?

904
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:39,829
Stop! Stop!

905
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:41,699
You're going the wrong way.

906
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:43,466
We have to get to Berlin.

907
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:45,564
Brody's this way.

908
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:47,438
My diary's in Berlin.

909
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:49,774
We don't
need the diary, Dad.

910
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:51,403
Marcus has the map.

911
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:54,643
There is more in the diary
than just the map.

912
01:05:55,818 --> 01:05:57,982
All right, Dad. Tell me.

913
01:05:57,982 --> 01:06:03,716
Well, he who finds the Grail
must face the final challenge.

914
01:06:03,787 --> 01:06:05,220
What final challenge?

915
01:06:05,289 --> 01:06:08,452
Three devices
of such lethal cunning.

916
01:06:08,525 --> 01:06:09,685
Booby traps?

917
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,057
Oh, yes.

918
01:06:11,128 --> 01:06:14,529
But l found the clues that
will safely take us through,

919
01:06:14,598 --> 01:06:16,828
in the Chronicles
of St. Anselm.

920
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:19,300
Well, what are they?

921
01:06:22,873 --> 01:06:24,238
Can't you remember?

922
01:06:25,943 --> 01:06:27,467
l wrote them down in my diary

923
01:06:27,544 --> 01:06:30,069
so that l wouldn't have
to remember.

924
01:06:30,147 --> 01:06:31,876
Half the German army's
on our tail,

925
01:06:31,949 --> 01:06:33,644
and you want me to go
to Berlin?

926
01:06:33,717 --> 01:06:34,741
lnto the lion's den?

927
01:06:34,818 --> 01:06:35,807
Yes.

928
01:06:35,886 --> 01:06:37,786
The only thing that matters
is the Grail.

929
01:06:37,855 --> 01:06:39,220
What about Marcus?

930
01:06:39,289 --> 01:06:41,280
Marcus would agree with me.

931
01:06:41,358 --> 01:06:43,826
Two selfless martyrs.

932
01:06:43,894 --> 01:06:45,794
Jesus Christ.

933
01:06:48,966 --> 01:06:50,524
That's for blasphemy.

934
01:06:53,704 --> 01:06:59,199
The quest for the Grail
is not archaeology.

935
01:06:59,276 --> 01:07:01,836
lt's a race against evil.

936
01:07:01,912 --> 01:07:05,643
lf it is captured by the Nazis,
the armies of darkness

937
01:07:05,716 --> 01:07:08,184
will march all over
the face of the Earth.

938
01:07:08,252 --> 01:07:09,651
Do you understand me?

939
01:07:11,622 --> 01:07:13,487
This is an obsession, Dad.

940
01:07:13,557 --> 01:07:15,616
l never understood it.

941
01:07:15,692 --> 01:07:17,091
Never.

942
01:07:18,896 --> 01:07:20,488
Neither did Mom.

943
01:07:20,564 --> 01:07:22,555
Oh, yes, she did.

944
01:07:22,633 --> 01:07:24,601
Only too well.

945
01:07:24,668 --> 01:07:30,072
Unfortunately, she kept
her illness from me

946
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:32,768
until all l could do
was mourn her.

947
01:08:35,405 --> 01:08:39,000
My boy, we are pilgrims
in an unholy land.

948
01:09:08,472 --> 01:09:10,463
Fraulein Doctor.

949
01:09:10,541 --> 01:09:11,667
Where is it?

950
01:09:11,742 --> 01:09:12,834
How did you get here?

951
01:09:12,910 --> 01:09:14,070
Where is it?

952
01:09:14,144 --> 01:09:16,510
l want it.

953
01:09:17,915 --> 01:09:20,850
You came back for the book? Why?

954
01:09:20,984 --> 01:09:22,849
My father didn't want
it incinerated.

955
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:25,445
ls that
what you think of me?

956
01:09:25,522 --> 01:09:27,319
l believe in the Grail,
not the swastika.

957
01:09:27,391 --> 01:09:28,722
But you stood up to be counted

958
01:09:28,792 --> 01:09:31,283
with the enemy of everything
that the Grail stands for.

959
01:09:31,361 --> 01:09:33,295
Who gives a damn what you think?

960
01:09:33,363 --> 01:09:34,853
You do.

961
01:09:34,932 --> 01:09:38,663
All l have to
do is squeeze.

962
01:09:38,735 --> 01:09:40,999
All l have to do is scream.

963
01:09:50,214 --> 01:09:51,306
l've got it.

964
01:09:51,381 --> 01:09:53,349
Let's get the hell out of here.

965
01:11:05,489 --> 01:11:06,581
What did you get?

966
01:11:06,657 --> 01:11:07,783
l don't know.

967
01:11:07,858 --> 01:11:09,792
First available flight
out of Germany.

968
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:11,919
Good.

969
01:11:36,186 --> 01:11:39,451
Well, we made it.

970
01:11:39,523 --> 01:11:42,856
When we're airborne,
with Germany behind us,

971
01:11:42,926 --> 01:11:45,793
then l'll share
that sentiment.

972
01:11:45,862 --> 01:11:47,955
Relax.

973
01:12:32,642 --> 01:12:34,940
Tickets, please.

974
01:12:46,490 --> 01:12:48,151
Guten Tag...

975
01:12:48,225 --> 01:12:49,954
Herr Jones.

976
01:12:53,530 --> 01:12:54,792
Tickets, please.

977
01:13:07,377 --> 01:13:09,345
Oh, we should
get out of here.

978
01:13:10,881 --> 01:13:12,644
No ticket.

979
01:13:15,352 --> 01:13:16,046
Ticket.

980
01:13:16,119 --> 01:13:17,518
-Ticket!
-Ticket!

981
01:13:17,587 --> 01:13:18,986
-Ticket! -Ticket!

982
01:13:36,273 --> 01:13:37,604
You know,

983
01:13:37,674 --> 01:13:42,077
sharing your adventures is
an interesting experience.

984
01:13:42,145 --> 01:13:44,409
That's not all we shared.

985
01:13:44,481 --> 01:13:45,914
lt's disgraceful.

986
01:13:45,982 --> 01:13:47,677
You're old enough
to be her fa...

987
01:13:47,751 --> 01:13:49,013
her-her grandfather.

988
01:13:49,085 --> 01:13:51,053
Well, l'm as human
as the next man.

989
01:13:51,121 --> 01:13:53,089
l was the next man.

990
01:13:53,156 --> 01:13:54,282
Oh.

991
01:13:55,492 --> 01:13:57,084
Of course. Well...

992
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:59,651
Ships that pass
in the night.

993
01:13:59,729 --> 01:14:03,165
Do you remember the last time
we had a quiet drink, hmm?

994
01:14:05,202 --> 01:14:06,533
l had a milkshake.

995
01:14:06,603 --> 01:14:08,537
Hmm?

996
01:14:08,605 --> 01:14:10,800
What did we
talk about?

997
01:14:10,874 --> 01:14:12,865
We didn't talk.

998
01:14:12,976 --> 01:14:15,342
We never talked.

999
01:14:15,412 --> 01:14:20,247
Do l detect
a rebuke?

1000
01:14:20,317 --> 01:14:22,285
A regret.

1001
01:14:22,352 --> 01:14:23,842
lt was just the two of us, Dad.

1002
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,478
lt was a lonely way to grow up.

1003
01:14:25,555 --> 01:14:26,681
For you, too.

1004
01:14:26,756 --> 01:14:28,519
lf you'd been an ordinary,
average father,

1005
01:14:28,592 --> 01:14:30,856
like the other guys' dads,
you'd have understood that.

1006
01:14:30,927 --> 01:14:34,021
Actually, l was
a wonderful father.

1007
01:14:34,097 --> 01:14:36,065
When?

1008
01:14:36,132 --> 01:14:37,997
Did l ever tell
you to eat up?

1009
01:14:38,068 --> 01:14:39,660
Go to bed?
Wash your ears?

1010
01:14:39,736 --> 01:14:41,260
Do your homework? No.

1011
01:14:41,338 --> 01:14:43,135
l respected
your privacy,

1012
01:14:43,206 --> 01:14:45,470
and l taught
you self-reliance.

1013
01:14:45,542 --> 01:14:46,566
What you taught me was

1014
01:14:46,643 --> 01:14:48,110
that l was
less important to you

1015
01:14:48,178 --> 01:14:49,577
than people
who'd been dead

1016
01:14:49,646 --> 01:14:51,204
for 500 years
in another country.

1017
01:14:51,281 --> 01:14:53,044
And l learned it so well

1018
01:14:53,116 --> 01:14:55,914
that we've hardly spoken
for 20 years.

1019
01:14:55,986 --> 01:14:58,250
You left just when you
were becoming interesting.

1020
01:14:58,321 --> 01:14:59,788
Unbelievable.

1021
01:14:59,856 --> 01:15:00,914
Dad, how can you...?

1022
01:15:01,024 --> 01:15:02,048
Very well.

1023
01:15:02,125 --> 01:15:04,559
l'm here now.

1024
01:15:04,628 --> 01:15:06,653
What do you want
to talk about?

1025
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:07,856
Hmm?

1026
01:15:07,998 --> 01:15:10,398
Well, l...

1027
01:15:12,369 --> 01:15:14,064
Uh...

1028
01:15:17,841 --> 01:15:20,105
l can't think of anything.

1029
01:15:20,176 --> 01:15:22,235
Then what are
you complaining about?

1030
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:25,848
Look, we have work to do.

1031
01:15:27,517 --> 01:15:29,451
When we get to
Alexandretta,

1032
01:15:29,519 --> 01:15:31,817
we will face
three challenges.

1033
01:15:31,888 --> 01:15:33,822
The first,

1034
01:15:33,890 --> 01:15:35,414
''The Breath of God.

1035
01:15:35,492 --> 01:15:37,756
Only the penitent
man will pass.''

1036
01:15:37,827 --> 01:15:39,089
Second,

1037
01:15:39,162 --> 01:15:40,424
''The Word of God.

1038
01:15:40,497 --> 01:15:44,058
Only in the footsteps
of God will he proceed.''

1039
01:15:44,134 --> 01:15:45,226
Third,

1040
01:15:45,302 --> 01:15:46,792
''The Path of God.

1041
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:48,895
''Only in the leap
from the lion's head

1042
01:15:48,972 --> 01:15:51,532
will he prove his worth.''

1043
01:15:53,643 --> 01:15:55,668
What does that mean?

1044
01:15:55,745 --> 01:15:57,679
l don't know.

1045
01:15:57,747 --> 01:15:59,180
We'll find out.

1046
01:16:05,689 --> 01:16:08,715
We're turning around.

1047
01:16:08,792 --> 01:16:11,226
They're taking us back
to Germany.

1048
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:19,564
Well, l thought
it would take them a lot longer

1049
01:16:19,636 --> 01:16:20,967
to figure out
the radio was dead.

1050
01:16:21,037 --> 01:16:23,005
Come on, Dad. Move!

1051
01:16:26,710 --> 01:16:29,008
Come on, Dad. Come on!

1052
01:16:42,959 --> 01:16:45,086
l didn't know you
could fly a plane.

1053
01:16:45,161 --> 01:16:46,321
Fly, yes.

1054
01:16:48,565 --> 01:16:50,863
Land, no.

1055
01:17:14,391 --> 01:17:16,552
Dad, you're going to have
to use the machine gun.

1056
01:17:16,626 --> 01:17:18,821
Get it ready.

1057
01:17:18,895 --> 01:17:21,295
Eleven o'clock!

1058
01:17:21,364 --> 01:17:23,628
Dad, eleven o'clock!

1059
01:17:24,701 --> 01:17:27,169
What happens at eleven o'clock?

1060
01:17:27,237 --> 01:17:29,205
Twelve, eleven, ten.

1061
01:17:29,272 --> 01:17:31,240
Eleven o'clock, fire!

1062
01:17:57,734 --> 01:17:59,793
Dad, are we hit?!

1063
01:17:59,869 --> 01:18:01,894
More or less.

1064
01:18:01,971 --> 01:18:03,836
Son, l'm sorry.

1065
01:18:03,973 --> 01:18:06,066
They got us.

1066
01:18:08,044 --> 01:18:09,033
Hang on, Dad.

1067
01:18:09,112 --> 01:18:10,374
We're going in!

1068
01:18:23,059 --> 01:18:24,185
Nice landing.

1069
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:26,285
Thanks.

1070
01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:42,200
Those people are
trying to kill us!

1071
01:18:42,278 --> 01:18:43,370
l know, Dad!

1072
01:18:43,446 --> 01:18:44,811
Well.

1073
01:18:44,881 --> 01:18:46,872
lt's a new
experience for me.

1074
01:18:46,950 --> 01:18:49,510
lt happens to me all the time.

1075
01:19:19,983 --> 01:19:21,951
This is intolerable!

1076
01:19:23,319 --> 01:19:24,684
This could be close.

1077
01:19:32,996 --> 01:19:35,556
Faster, boy! Faster!

1078
01:19:51,214 --> 01:19:53,580
Well, they don't come
any closer than that!

1079
01:20:09,399 --> 01:20:12,232
Dad, he's coming back!

1080
01:20:58,781 --> 01:21:01,341
l suddenly
remembered my Charlemagne.

1081
01:21:01,417 --> 01:21:04,318
''Let my armies be the rocks
and the trees

1082
01:21:04,387 --> 01:21:06,548
and the birds in the sky.''

1083
01:21:24,073 --> 01:21:25,267
These pages are taken

1084
01:21:25,341 --> 01:21:27,832
from Professor Jones'
diary, Your Highness,

1085
01:21:27,911 --> 01:21:29,208
and they include a map

1086
01:21:29,279 --> 01:21:32,043
that pinpoints the exact
location of the Grail.

1087
01:21:32,115 --> 01:21:34,709
As you can see, the Grail
is all but in our hands.

1088
01:21:34,784 --> 01:21:35,910
However, Your Highness,

1089
01:21:36,019 --> 01:21:38,078
we would not think
of crossing your soil

1090
01:21:38,154 --> 01:21:39,416
without your permission,

1091
01:21:39,489 --> 01:21:41,719
nor of removing the
Grail from your borders

1092
01:21:41,791 --> 01:21:44,760
without suitable
compensation.

1093
01:21:46,996 --> 01:21:49,123
What have you brought?

1094
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:59,640
Precious valuables,
Your Highness,

1095
01:21:59,709 --> 01:22:02,644
donated by some
of the finest families

1096
01:22:02,712 --> 01:22:04,771
in all of Germany.

1097
01:22:07,951 --> 01:22:09,282
Ah!

1098
01:22:09,352 --> 01:22:12,321
Rolls-Royce
Phantom Two.

1099
01:22:12,388 --> 01:22:13,878
Four-point-three liter,

1100
01:22:13,957 --> 01:22:16,482
30 horsepower,
six-cylinder engine,

1101
01:22:16,559 --> 01:22:19,221
with Stromberg
downdraft carburetor.

1102
01:22:19,295 --> 01:22:22,822
Can go from zero to
1 00 kilometers an hour

1103
01:22:22,899 --> 01:22:25,231
in 1 2.5 seconds.

1104
01:22:25,301 --> 01:22:27,462
And l even
like the color.

1105
01:22:27,537 --> 01:22:30,938
The keys are in the ignition,
Your Highness.

1106
01:22:32,241 --> 01:22:34,732
You shall have
camels, horses,

1107
01:22:34,811 --> 01:22:36,745
an armed escort, provisions,

1108
01:22:36,813 --> 01:22:38,747
desert vehicles

1109
01:22:38,815 --> 01:22:40,009
and tanks.

1110
01:22:40,083 --> 01:22:42,051
You're welcome.

1111
01:22:57,633 --> 01:22:59,066
We have no time to lose.

1112
01:22:59,135 --> 01:23:01,763
lndiana Jones
and his father have escaped.

1113
01:23:04,507 --> 01:23:06,407
We go this way.

1114
01:23:06,476 --> 01:23:08,034
Get that camel
out of the way.

1115
01:23:10,513 --> 01:23:12,242
What happened
to Marcus, Sallah?

1116
01:23:12,315 --> 01:23:15,182
Ah, they set out across
the desert this afternoon.

1117
01:23:15,251 --> 01:23:18,084
l believe they took
Mr. Brody with them.

1118
01:23:19,522 --> 01:23:22,286
Now they have the map.

1119
01:23:22,358 --> 01:23:24,986
And in this sort of race,

1120
01:23:25,061 --> 01:23:28,326
there's no silver medal
for finishing second.

1121
01:23:50,153 --> 01:23:52,883
Care to wet your
whistle, Marcus?

1122
01:23:52,955 --> 01:23:54,923
l'd rather spit
in your face.

1123
01:23:55,058 --> 01:23:57,151
But as l haven't
got any spit...

1124
01:23:59,829 --> 01:24:02,127
Must be within
three or four miles.

1125
01:24:02,198 --> 01:24:04,928
Otherwise we are
off the map.

1126
01:24:06,702 --> 01:24:09,432
Well, Marcus,
we are on the brink

1127
01:24:09,505 --> 01:24:11,632
of the recovery
of the greatest artifact

1128
01:24:11,707 --> 01:24:13,106
in the history
of mankind.

1129
01:24:13,176 --> 01:24:15,667
You're meddling with powers

1130
01:24:15,745 --> 01:24:18,612
you cannot
possibly comprehend.

1131
01:24:23,953 --> 01:24:26,581
Ah, l see Brody.

1132
01:24:26,656 --> 01:24:29,124
He seems okay.

1133
01:24:32,028 --> 01:24:33,620
They've got a tank.

1134
01:24:39,635 --> 01:24:41,227
Six-pound gun.

1135
01:24:41,304 --> 01:24:43,033
What do you think
you're doing there?

1136
01:24:43,106 --> 01:24:44,038
Get down!

1137
01:24:44,107 --> 01:24:46,701
Dad, we're well out of range.

1138
01:24:56,819 --> 01:24:58,753
That car belonged
to my brother-in-law.

1139
01:24:58,821 --> 01:25:00,083
Come on, come on!

1140
01:25:00,156 --> 01:25:02,056
l can't see anyone up there.

1141
01:25:02,125 --> 01:25:03,854
Maybe it wasn't
even Jones.

1142
01:25:03,926 --> 01:25:05,484
No, it is him,
all right.

1143
01:25:05,561 --> 01:25:07,256
He's here somewhere.

1144
01:25:07,330 --> 01:25:10,060
Put Brody in the tank.

1145
01:25:17,773 --> 01:25:20,333
Well, in this sun,

1146
01:25:20,409 --> 01:25:22,707
without transportation,
they're as good as dead.

1147
01:25:32,355 --> 01:25:34,016
lt's Jones, all right.

1148
01:25:38,194 --> 01:25:39,684
Now, who are
all these people?

1149
01:25:39,762 --> 01:25:40,694
Who cares?

1150
01:25:40,763 --> 01:25:42,697
As long as they're
keeping Donovan busy.

1151
01:25:42,765 --> 01:25:44,562
Dad, you stay here
while Sallah and l

1152
01:25:44,634 --> 01:25:46,693
organize some transportation.

1153
01:26:11,227 --> 01:26:12,854
l'm going after those horses.

1154
01:26:12,929 --> 01:26:13,861
l'll take the camels.

1155
01:26:13,996 --> 01:26:14,963
l don't need camels.

1156
01:26:15,031 --> 01:26:15,963
But, lndy...

1157
01:26:16,032 --> 01:26:17,124
No camels.

1158
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:29,477
Who is he?

1159
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:34,215
A messenger from God.

1160
01:26:34,283 --> 01:26:36,649
For the unrighteous,

1161
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:41,088
the Cup of Life
holds everlasting damnation.

1162
01:26:59,508 --> 01:27:00,475
Marcus!

1163
01:27:01,510 --> 01:27:02,568
Oh.

1164
01:27:02,645 --> 01:27:05,773
''Genius of the Restoration...''

1165
01:27:05,848 --> 01:27:08,840
''Aid our own resuscitation.''

1166
01:27:08,918 --> 01:27:10,180
Henry, what are you
doing here?

1167
01:27:10,253 --> 01:27:11,618
lt's a rescue, old boy.
Come on.

1168
01:27:18,027 --> 01:27:19,221
Search him.

1169
01:27:19,295 --> 01:27:21,525
What is in this book?

1170
01:27:21,597 --> 01:27:25,158
That miserable
little diary of yours.

1171
01:27:25,234 --> 01:27:27,395
We have the map.
The book is useless.

1172
01:27:27,470 --> 01:27:30,735
And yet you come all the way
back to Berlin to get it.

1173
01:27:30,806 --> 01:27:31,864
Why?

1174
01:27:31,941 --> 01:27:34,842
What are you hiding?

1175
01:27:34,910 --> 01:27:36,571
What does the diary
tell you

1176
01:27:36,646 --> 01:27:39,376
that it doesn't
tell us?

1177
01:27:39,448 --> 01:27:42,884
lt tells me that goose-stepping
morons like yourself

1178
01:27:43,019 --> 01:27:46,819
should try reading books
instead of burning them.

1179
01:27:46,889 --> 01:27:48,379
Colonel!

1180
01:27:48,457 --> 01:27:49,856
Jones is getting away.

1181
01:27:49,925 --> 01:27:51,654
l think not,

1182
01:27:51,727 --> 01:27:53,024
Herr Donovan.

1183
01:27:53,095 --> 01:27:55,529
Not that Jones,
the other Jones!

1184
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:07,502
Sallah, l said no camels!

1185
01:28:07,576 --> 01:28:08,702
That's five camels.

1186
01:28:08,778 --> 01:28:09,767
Can't you count?

1187
01:28:09,845 --> 01:28:12,075
Compensation for
my brother-in-law's car.

1188
01:28:12,148 --> 01:28:14,343
lndy, your father
and Brody...

1189
01:28:14,417 --> 01:28:15,816
Where's my father?

1190
01:28:15,885 --> 01:28:17,045
They have them.

1191
01:28:17,119 --> 01:28:19,417
ln the belly
of that steel beast.

1192
01:28:21,791 --> 01:28:23,520
Hyah!

1193
01:28:31,067 --> 01:28:32,557
Hyah, hyah, hyah!

1194
01:28:32,635 --> 01:28:34,227
Hey-ah, hey-ah, hey-ah!

1195
01:28:42,478 --> 01:28:43,604
Fire!

1196
01:30:44,233 --> 01:30:46,929
Dad! Dad!

1197
01:30:47,002 --> 01:30:47,866
Dad!

1198
01:30:47,937 --> 01:30:49,234
Junior?

1199
01:30:49,305 --> 01:30:50,772
Junior?!

1200
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:52,068
Junior!

1201
01:32:06,749 --> 01:32:08,239
Dad!

1202
01:32:10,052 --> 01:32:11,110
Dad!

1203
01:32:11,186 --> 01:32:12,915
Dad! Get out!

1204
01:33:32,968 --> 01:33:34,697
Henry, the pen...

1205
01:33:34,770 --> 01:33:36,397
-What?
-But don't you see?

1206
01:33:36,472 --> 01:33:39,703
The pen is mightier
than the sword.

1207
01:34:02,031 --> 01:34:03,589
Look what you did.

1208
01:34:03,666 --> 01:34:05,258
lt's war.

1209
01:34:10,973 --> 01:34:12,702
Didn't l tell you
it was a rescue, huh?

1210
01:35:17,039 --> 01:35:18,301
Dad!

1211
01:35:18,373 --> 01:35:20,170
Yeah?

1212
01:35:20,242 --> 01:35:22,073
You call this archaeology?

1213
01:35:22,144 --> 01:35:23,372
Get out of there, Dad.

1214
01:35:34,389 --> 01:35:36,448
How does one
get off this thing?

1215
01:35:43,398 --> 01:35:44,456
Where's Marcus?

1216
01:35:48,303 --> 01:35:49,702
Dad!

1217
01:35:54,143 --> 01:35:55,303
Hang on, Dad!

1218
01:36:01,750 --> 01:36:04,241
Father of lndy,
give me your hand!

1219
01:36:04,319 --> 01:36:06,082
Sallah!

1220
01:36:06,155 --> 01:36:07,520
Get Dad!

1221
01:36:07,589 --> 01:36:09,489
Give me your hand!

1222
01:36:58,040 --> 01:36:59,769
Junior!

1223
01:37:01,910 --> 01:37:03,241
lndy!

1224
01:37:12,454 --> 01:37:14,684
Oh, God.

1225
01:37:14,756 --> 01:37:16,849
l've lost him.

1226
01:37:19,895 --> 01:37:24,696
And l never told him anything.

1227
01:37:24,766 --> 01:37:28,862
l just wasn't ready, Marcus.

1228
01:37:29,004 --> 01:37:32,940
Five minutes
would have been enough.

1229
01:38:08,610 --> 01:38:11,636
l thought
l'd lost you, boy!

1230
01:38:11,713 --> 01:38:15,479
l thought
you had too, sir.

1231
01:38:15,550 --> 01:38:18,178
Mmm...

1232
01:38:28,063 --> 01:38:31,863
Well...

1233
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,867
Well done. Come on.

1234
01:38:37,472 --> 01:38:39,838
Let's go, then.

1235
01:38:41,310 --> 01:38:43,301
Why are you
sitting there resting

1236
01:38:43,378 --> 01:38:45,175
when we're so near the end?!

1237
01:38:45,247 --> 01:38:47,511
Come on, let's go!

1238
01:38:59,461 --> 01:39:03,693
The Canyon
of the Crescent Moon.

1239
01:41:30,812 --> 01:41:32,473
Helmut, another volunteer!

1240
01:42:01,109 --> 01:42:03,634
l never expected
to see you again.

1241
01:42:03,712 --> 01:42:06,647
l'm like a bad penny;
l always turn up.

1242
01:42:06,715 --> 01:42:08,842
Step back now,
Dr. Schneider.

1243
01:42:08,917 --> 01:42:10,748
Give Dr. Jones some room.

1244
01:42:10,819 --> 01:42:13,811
He's going to recover
the Grail for us.

1245
01:42:15,857 --> 01:42:18,417
lmpossible?
What do you say, Jones?

1246
01:42:18,493 --> 01:42:20,620
Ready to go down in history?

1247
01:42:20,695 --> 01:42:21,889
As what?

1248
01:42:21,963 --> 01:42:23,624
A Nazi stooge like you?

1249
01:42:23,698 --> 01:42:25,461
The Nazis?!

1250
01:42:25,534 --> 01:42:28,469
ls that the limit
of your vision?

1251
01:42:28,537 --> 01:42:30,368
The Nazis want
to write themselves

1252
01:42:30,438 --> 01:42:31,803
into the Grail legend...

1253
01:42:31,873 --> 01:42:33,500
take on the world.

1254
01:42:33,575 --> 01:42:36,874
Well, they're welcome.

1255
01:42:36,945 --> 01:42:39,470
But l want
the Grail itself.

1256
01:42:39,548 --> 01:42:43,245
The cup that gives
everlasting life.

1257
01:42:43,318 --> 01:42:44,649
Hitler can have
the world,

1258
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:46,277
but he can't
take it with him.

1259
01:42:46,354 --> 01:42:49,016
l'm going to be
drinking my own health

1260
01:42:49,090 --> 01:42:51,615
when he's gone the way
of the dodo.

1261
01:42:55,096 --> 01:42:56,529
The Grail is mine...

1262
01:42:56,598 --> 01:42:59,032
and you're going
to get it for me.

1263
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:01,591
Shooting me
won't get you anywhere.

1264
01:43:01,670 --> 01:43:03,763
You know something,
Dr. Jones?

1265
01:43:03,838 --> 01:43:05,635
You're absolutely right.

1266
01:43:08,610 --> 01:43:10,578
Dad?

1267
01:43:10,645 --> 01:43:11,873
Dad?!

1268
01:43:12,013 --> 01:43:13,742
Junior...

1269
01:43:13,815 --> 01:43:15,612
-No!
-Get back!

1270
01:43:33,535 --> 01:43:35,628
You can't save him
when you're dead!

1271
01:43:35,704 --> 01:43:37,069
The healing power
of the Grail

1272
01:43:37,138 --> 01:43:39,402
is the only thing
that can save your father now.

1273
01:43:39,474 --> 01:43:42,932
lt's time to ask yourself
what you believe.

1274
01:44:16,978 --> 01:44:21,472
''The Breath of God...

1275
01:44:21,549 --> 01:44:25,178
...only the penitent man
will pass.''

1276
01:44:25,253 --> 01:44:28,188
''The penitent man will pass.

1277
01:44:46,141 --> 01:44:48,905
The penitent man will pass.

1278
01:44:49,010 --> 01:44:51,672
The penitent man...

1279
01:44:54,115 --> 01:44:56,640
''Only the penitent man
will pass.''

1280
01:44:56,718 --> 01:44:59,278
''Only the penitent
man will pass.''

1281
01:44:59,354 --> 01:45:01,288
The penitent man will pass.

1282
01:45:01,356 --> 01:45:03,221
The penitent, penitent...

1283
01:45:03,291 --> 01:45:04,849
The penitent man...

1284
01:45:04,959 --> 01:45:06,392
The penitent man...

1285
01:45:06,461 --> 01:45:07,519
The penitent...

1286
01:45:07,595 --> 01:45:10,621
The penitent man
is humble before God.

1287
01:45:10,699 --> 01:45:12,462
Penitent. Penitent...

1288
01:45:12,534 --> 01:45:14,365
The penitent man...

1289
01:45:14,436 --> 01:45:17,599
Penitent man
is humble...

1290
01:45:17,672 --> 01:45:19,196
...kneels before God.

1291
01:45:19,274 --> 01:45:20,241
Kneel!

1292
01:45:29,117 --> 01:45:30,482
l'm through!

1293
01:45:30,552 --> 01:45:34,113
We're through.

1294
01:45:36,091 --> 01:45:37,752
He's all right.

1295
01:45:37,826 --> 01:45:39,384
No.

1296
01:45:39,461 --> 01:45:42,453
The second challenge:
''The Word of God.''

1297
01:45:42,530 --> 01:45:46,057
''Only in the footsteps
of God will he proceed.''

1298
01:45:49,904 --> 01:45:52,498
The Word of God...

1299
01:45:52,574 --> 01:45:53,939
The Word of...

1300
01:45:57,145 --> 01:46:00,603
Proceed in the footsteps
of the Word.

1301
01:46:00,682 --> 01:46:01,944
''The Word of God...''

1302
01:46:02,016 --> 01:46:03,881
No, Henry.
Try not to talk.

1303
01:46:10,492 --> 01:46:13,461
The name of God...

1304
01:46:13,528 --> 01:46:18,522
The name of God...

1305
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:21,364
Jehovah.

1306
01:46:21,436 --> 01:46:26,999
But in the Latin alphabet,
Jehovah begins with an ''l.''

1307
01:46:27,075 --> 01:46:29,100
J...

1308
01:46:34,916 --> 01:46:36,042
Oh, dear.

1309
01:46:40,588 --> 01:46:41,850
ldiot!

1310
01:46:41,923 --> 01:46:45,552
ln Latin, Jehovah
starts with an ''l.''

1311
01:46:47,162 --> 01:46:49,357
''l''...

1312
01:46:49,431 --> 01:46:51,797
''E''...

1313
01:46:51,866 --> 01:46:53,390
''H''...

1314
01:46:53,468 --> 01:46:54,662
''O''...

1315
01:46:54,736 --> 01:46:55,668
Oh!

1316
01:46:55,737 --> 01:46:58,137
''V''...

1317
01:46:58,206 --> 01:46:59,730
''A''...

1318
01:47:22,030 --> 01:47:23,998
''The Path of God.''

1319
01:47:26,634 --> 01:47:29,660
''Only in the leap
from the lion's head

1320
01:47:29,737 --> 01:47:33,673
will he prove his worth.''

1321
01:47:35,910 --> 01:47:40,711
lmpossible...
nobody can jump this.

1322
01:47:41,649 --> 01:47:43,583
lndy!

1323
01:47:43,651 --> 01:47:45,676
lndy, you must hurry!

1324
01:47:45,753 --> 01:47:47,243
Come quickly!

1325
01:47:53,495 --> 01:47:55,895
lt's a leap of faith.

1326
01:47:55,964 --> 01:47:57,454
Oh, geez...

1327
01:47:57,532 --> 01:48:00,092
You must believe, boy.

1328
01:48:00,168 --> 01:48:02,466
You must... believe.

1329
01:49:40,435 --> 01:49:42,562
Oh.

1330
01:49:48,910 --> 01:49:51,174
l knew you'd come,

1331
01:49:51,245 --> 01:49:53,839
but my strength has left me.

1332
01:49:53,915 --> 01:49:55,940
Who are you?

1333
01:49:56,017 --> 01:49:58,417
The last of three brothers

1334
01:49:58,486 --> 01:50:01,250
who swore an oath
to find the Grail

1335
01:50:01,322 --> 01:50:03,483
and to guard it.

1336
01:50:03,558 --> 01:50:06,288
That was 700 years ago.

1337
01:50:06,361 --> 01:50:09,228
A long time to wait.

1338
01:50:10,298 --> 01:50:12,493
You're strangely dressed...

1339
01:50:12,567 --> 01:50:14,558
for a knight.

1340
01:50:14,636 --> 01:50:17,230
l'm not exactly...

1341
01:50:17,305 --> 01:50:18,397
a knight.

1342
01:50:18,473 --> 01:50:19,770
What do you mean?

1343
01:50:19,841 --> 01:50:22,036
l was chosen

1344
01:50:22,110 --> 01:50:25,204
because l was the bravest,
the most worthy.

1345
01:50:25,279 --> 01:50:27,213
The honor was mine

1346
01:50:27,281 --> 01:50:29,841
until another came
to challenge me

1347
01:50:29,917 --> 01:50:33,080
to single combat.

1348
01:50:33,154 --> 01:50:35,122
l pass it...

1349
01:50:35,189 --> 01:50:40,286
to you who vanquished me.

1350
01:50:42,063 --> 01:50:44,122
Listen, l don't have
time to explain, but...

1351
01:51:01,582 --> 01:51:03,777
Which one is it?

1352
01:51:03,851 --> 01:51:05,842
You must choose,

1353
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:08,320
but choose wisely.

1354
01:51:08,389 --> 01:51:11,187
For as the true Grail
will bring you life,

1355
01:51:11,259 --> 01:51:13,250
the false Grail

1356
01:51:13,327 --> 01:51:15,295
will take it from you.

1357
01:51:19,767 --> 01:51:22,668
l'm not a historian.

1358
01:51:22,737 --> 01:51:24,170
l have no idea

1359
01:51:24,238 --> 01:51:26,001
what it looks like.

1360
01:51:26,074 --> 01:51:27,564
Which one is it?

1361
01:51:27,642 --> 01:51:29,633
Let me choose.

1362
01:51:29,711 --> 01:51:32,145
Thank you, Doctor.

1363
01:51:45,193 --> 01:51:47,354
Oh, yes.

1364
01:51:51,966 --> 01:51:56,460
lt's more beautiful
than l'd ever imagined.

1365
01:52:06,914 --> 01:52:10,748
This certainly is the cup
of the King of Kings.

1366
01:52:17,125 --> 01:52:19,355
Eternal life.

1367
01:52:53,661 --> 01:52:56,425
What is happening to me?

1368
01:52:58,499 --> 01:52:59,830
Oh!

1369
01:53:01,068 --> 01:53:03,434
Tell me, what is happening?

1370
01:53:26,527 --> 01:53:28,461
He chose...

1371
01:53:28,529 --> 01:53:30,861
poorly.

1372
01:53:40,308 --> 01:53:42,970
lt would not be made
out of gold.

1373
01:53:43,044 --> 01:53:45,205
That's the cup
of a carpenter.

1374
01:53:55,056 --> 01:53:57,217
There's only one way
to find out.

1375
01:54:11,539 --> 01:54:16,203
You have chosen wisely.

1376
01:54:16,277 --> 01:54:21,146
But the Grail cannot pass
beyond the Great Seal.

1377
01:54:21,215 --> 01:54:26,050
That is the boundary
and the price of immortality.

1378
01:55:52,773 --> 01:55:55,640
Drop your guns. Please.

1379
01:55:58,879 --> 01:56:00,642
Dad, come on,
get to your feet.

1380
01:56:14,562 --> 01:56:17,156
We have got it. Come on!

1381
01:56:18,666 --> 01:56:21,134
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!

1382
01:56:21,202 --> 01:56:23,227
lt's ours, lndy--
yours and mine.

1383
01:56:23,304 --> 01:56:25,363
Elsa, don't cross the Seal.

1384
01:56:25,439 --> 01:56:26,633
The knight warned us

1385
01:56:26,707 --> 01:56:28,937
not to take
the Grail from here.

1386
01:56:55,503 --> 01:56:56,527
Junior!

1387
01:56:56,604 --> 01:56:58,003
Junior!

1388
01:57:00,841 --> 01:57:01,500
Elsa...

1389
01:57:03,210 --> 01:57:05,201
Elsa, don't. Elsa...

1390
01:57:05,279 --> 01:57:06,712
Elsa...

1391
01:57:06,781 --> 01:57:08,248
Give me your other hand, honey.

1392
01:57:08,315 --> 01:57:09,339
l can't hold you!

1393
01:57:09,417 --> 01:57:10,782
l can reach it.

1394
01:57:10,851 --> 01:57:12,546
l can reach it.

1395
01:57:12,620 --> 01:57:14,349
Elsa, give me your hand.
Give me your other hand!

1396
01:57:16,891 --> 01:57:17,880
Elsa!

1397
01:57:27,968 --> 01:57:30,300
Junior, give me
your other hand!

1398
01:57:30,371 --> 01:57:32,236
l can't hold on.

1399
01:57:32,306 --> 01:57:33,568
l can get it.

1400
01:57:33,641 --> 01:57:35,836
l can almost reach it, Dad.

1401
01:57:35,976 --> 01:57:37,568
lndiana...

1402
01:57:39,346 --> 01:57:40,574
lndiana...

1403
01:57:43,951 --> 01:57:46,181
Let it go.

1404
01:58:04,905 --> 01:58:07,339
Dad...

1405
01:58:13,848 --> 01:58:15,440
Please, Dad.

1406
01:58:46,580 --> 01:58:49,447
Elsa never really
believed in the Grail.

1407
01:58:49,517 --> 01:58:52,213
She thought she'd
found a prize.

1408
01:58:58,692 --> 01:59:01,092
What did you find, Dad?

1409
01:59:01,162 --> 01:59:02,652
Me?

1410
01:59:05,366 --> 01:59:06,890
lllumination.

1411
01:59:16,410 --> 01:59:17,934
And what did you find, Junior?

1412
01:59:18,012 --> 01:59:20,947
''Junior''? Dad...

1413
01:59:21,015 --> 01:59:22,812
Please, what does
it always mean,

1414
01:59:22,950 --> 01:59:24,212
this... this ''Junior''?

1415
01:59:24,285 --> 01:59:26,412
That's his name:
Henry Jones, Junior.

1416
01:59:26,487 --> 01:59:28,148
l like lndiana.

1417
01:59:28,222 --> 01:59:29,587
We named the dog lndiana.

1418
01:59:29,657 --> 01:59:31,056
May we go home now,

1419
01:59:31,125 --> 01:59:32,387
please?

1420
01:59:32,459 --> 01:59:33,619
The dog?

1421
01:59:35,462 --> 01:59:37,521
You are named after the dog?

1422
01:59:38,666 --> 01:59:42,932
l've got a lot of fond memories
of that dog.

1423
01:59:43,003 --> 01:59:45,767
Ready?

1424
01:59:45,839 --> 01:59:47,466
Ready.

1425
01:59:47,541 --> 01:59:49,509
lndy! Henry! Follow me.

1426
01:59:49,577 --> 01:59:51,340
l know the way! Ha!

1427
01:59:54,648 --> 01:59:57,981
Got lost
in his own museum, huh?

1428
01:59:58,052 --> 01:59:59,815
Uh-huh.

1429
01:59:59,887 --> 02:00:02,253
After you, Junior.

1430
02:00:02,323 --> 02:00:03,881
Yes, sir. Ha!
