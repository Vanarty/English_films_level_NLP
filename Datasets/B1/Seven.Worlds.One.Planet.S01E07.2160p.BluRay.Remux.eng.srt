1
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,677
Africa.

2
00:00:54,472 --> 00:01:00,228
No continent on Earth today
has such spectacular wildlife.

3
00:01:04,232 --> 00:01:09,153
At its heart lies
a vast tropical rainforest.

4
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:17,453
Over a million square miles
of wilderness,

5
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:21,207
much of it still unexplored...

6
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:22,708
...even now.

7
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:32,551
There are more species of animals
and plants in these jungles

8
00:01:32,677 --> 00:01:34,679
than anywhere else on the continent.

9
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:43,396
But even in this land of plenty...

10
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:47,942
...wildlife now faces major challenges.

11
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:06,210
The forests of the Ivory Coast

12
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:10,631
contain over 1,500 species of plant,

13
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:13,634
but some are very difficult to get at...

14
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:17,596
...even for one of
the most intelligent of animals.

15
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,317
Chimpanzees.

16
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:46,250
The elders in this group know
where to find the most nutritious food

17
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,920
and how to extract it.

18
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,508
But if they are to survive to adulthood,

19
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:58,888
the youngsters must learn these skills
from their parents.

20
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:15,738
This young female is five years old...

21
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:21,911
...old enough to be given
an important lesson.

22
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,471
And this is her teacher.

23
00:03:41,764 --> 00:03:43,265
Her mother.

24
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:53,275
The lesson is how to crack a nut.

25
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:08,624
Using tools like this is so complex

26
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:13,421
that it has only been mastered by
a handful of chimpanzee communities.

27
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:28,018
This is a skill that has been practised
by chimps for several thousand years.

28
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:43,534
Time to try for herself.

29
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:09,435
She needs to find a better tool.

30
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,791
Small rocks just don't have the clout.

31
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:39,715
And larger ones are too cumbersome.

32
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:49,391
Wood is both light and strong...

33
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:56,065
...but not strong enough.

34
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:03,489
Back to teacher.

35
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:11,830
It may take a young chimp
up to a decade to perfect

36
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:15,209
the skills it needs for nut-cracking.

37
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,464
But she's already mastered one thing.

38
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:28,472
When her fingers can't reach
the nut inside...

39
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:33,602
...she strips down a branch to size...

40
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:42,611
...and makes herself a spoon.

41
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:56,333
She'll learn to use many tools
in her life...

42
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,130
...and eventually she'll share
this knowledge

43
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:04,967
with youngsters of her own,

44
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:10,055
enabling them to harvest the riches
of their rainforest home.

45
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:18,814
The sheer abundance of life
in the rainforests

46
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:23,485
is rivalled by that
on the eastern side of the continent.

47
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:33,787
The Great Rift Valley runs for 4,000 miles
down the length of Africa.

48
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:38,208
It developed some 30 million years ago,

49
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:43,130
when a giant plume of molten rock
pushing up from the depths

50
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:46,425
cracked the Earth's crust apart.

51
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,397
Fresh water began to accumulate
on the floor of this rift...

52
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:04,902
...and a chain of lakes developed.

53
00:08:07,363 --> 00:08:11,450
These lakes are now
one of the richest freshwater habitats

54
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:13,118
to be found anywhere.

55
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:30,886
One single family of fish here -
the cichlids -

56
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:35,808
has evolved into more
than 1,500 different species.

57
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:45,317
This might look like paradise,

58
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:49,655
but competition between
these cichlid species is intense.

59
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:58,247
This crowded world is a dangerous one.

60
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:04,169
Baby fish, after all, make a tasty meal.

61
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:12,261
So, many cichlid mothers have developed
a very effective way

62
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:14,680
of keeping their offspring safe.

63
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:21,729
They use their mouths as a mobile nursery.

64
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:42,458
It's a safe haven where the fry can stay
until danger has passed.

65
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:49,798
When the coast is clear,
she releases them.

66
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:14,823
This kind of behaviour starts
when the cichlid female

67
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:19,870
picks up her newly laid eggs and holds
them in her mouth to keep them safe.

68
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:34,968
During spawning,
her mate flashes his yellow tail spots

69
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,179
to encourage her to keep laying.

70
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:47,439
As each batch of eggs emerges,

71
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,108
she scoops them up.

72
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:02,621
But this couple are being watched...

73
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:10,087
...by cuckoo catfish.

74
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,112
They work as a gang

75
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:40,158
and devour as many cichlid eggs
as they can find.

76
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:50,002
Then, in the middle of all this activity,

77
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:54,006
one of the catfish also spawns.

78
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:01,805
The cichlid mother
collects every egg she can see.

79
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:14,276
Now, by herself, she must wait

80
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,112
while the eggs in her mouth develop.

81
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:24,453
It will take three weeks.

82
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:31,418
She doesn't eat
throughout that entire time.

83
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:45,933
But 18 days later,

84
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:49,478
something is not right.

85
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:07,663
The female blows out her young
before they're fully ready to emerge.

86
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:16,588
And they are followed
by young cuckoo catfish...

87
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:29,601
...three times the size of her own babies.

88
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:34,690
She may have as many as six of them
in her mouth.

89
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,072
And now

90
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:45,325
they begin to eat the cichlid babies.

91
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:55,377
The female cichlid treats the baby catfish
as if they were hers.

92
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:03,427
They are truly cuckoos among fish!

93
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:17,357
The forces that created
the Great Rift Valley

94
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:20,444
continue to shape Africa's landscape

95
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:22,529
even today.

96
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:32,456
At weak spots in the Earth's crust,
molten rock continues to erupt.

97
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,090
There are some 200 volcanoes
on the continent...

98
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:49,931
...many of them active.

99
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:02,069
They may bring destruction

100
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:06,615
but also, eventually, fertility.

101
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:18,210
This is Ol Doinyo Lengai.

102
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:26,384
For the past 400,000 years,
ash from this great volcano

103
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:30,764
has fallen on the surrounding savannas
of the Serengeti

104
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:33,058
and greatly enriched them.

105
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:42,609
This is the best grazing on the continent.

106
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:55,956
On it live the world's largest herds
of migrating animals...

107
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:03,296
...and they, in turn, support predators.

108
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:25,360
Here, in Kenya, cheetahs have formed
an unusual alliance.

109
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:37,831
These swiftest of cats usually hunt
in groups of two or three.

110
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:43,837
But this team of five
is one of the largest ever recorded.

111
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:01,021
Two sets of brothers

112
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:03,231
and a lead male.

113
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:11,573
They have now lived and hunted together
for almost three years.

114
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:30,217
By teaming up, they can hold

115
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:33,345
the best territory in the area.

116
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:41,978
But, even so, with five mouths to feed,
every hunt is very important.

117
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:53,448
They haven't eaten for three days.

118
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:03,833
To make a kill, they must get
within 30 metres of their quarry

119
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:06,461
without being detected.

120
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,347
Thick cover.

121
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:20,267
That will help them.

122
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:40,996
Topi - nearly three times their size...

123
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,796
...and quite strong enough
to fight off a lion,

124
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:52,048
let alone a single cheetah.

125
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:05,603
Now out in the open...

126
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:10,650
...every step the cheetahs take
increases their chance of success.

127
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:41,139
The herd scatter,
and the team splits up.

128
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,060
But they didn't get close enough.

129
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:51,608
They switch targets to zebra.

130
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:26,226
Everyone now knows that they're here.

131
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:38,446
They must devise a different approach.

132
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,794
All eyes are on the brothers.

133
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:08,393
Out in the open,
they seem to be no threat.

134
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:14,399
But the lead male is missing.

135
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,793
The brothers are decoys.

136
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:50,602
The trap is set.

137
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:02,257
The other four now join the lead male.

138
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,472
Under the combined weight of five cheetah,

139
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:12,475
death comes quickly.

140
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:32,996
Today, Africa's savannas support
larger herds of big game

141
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:35,999
than anywhere else in the world.

142
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,837
And they, one way or another,

143
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:44,549
provide food for all kinds
of smaller creatures.

144
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:50,263
An oxpecker.

145
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:58,730
A resourceful little bird
with an unusual diet.

146
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:19,042
Fleas, ticks and even dandruff are food,

147
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:21,836
as far as they are concerned.

148
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:42,273
Both parties benefit.

149
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,446
The oxpecker gets a good meal...

150
00:24:48,571 --> 00:24:53,993
...and the host is cleaned in those places
it could never reach for itself.

151
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:14,389
Each bird, every day,
collects hundreds of ticks

152
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:16,974
and thousands of insect larvae.

153
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:23,940
But some oxpeckers
go for rather riskier meals.

154
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:40,707
Hippopotamus are highly territorial
and very aggressive...

155
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:48,256
...so oxpeckers tackling them
must always be on their guard.

156
00:25:54,846 --> 00:25:56,848
But there's much to be gained.

157
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:11,446
Blood is the most nutritious meal of all.

158
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:17,952
Pecking ensures that cuts remain open
and blood keeps flowing.

159
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:25,752
And an oxpecker,
once it's found an open wound,

160
00:26:25,877 --> 00:26:30,506
will stay alongside it, no matter
how much that irritates its host.

161
00:26:46,898 --> 00:26:52,236
The reward? An endless supply of food,

162
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,697
whatever the conditions.

163
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:05,875
Not all of Africa is rich and fertile.

164
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,426
A third of the continent is desert.

165
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:33,361
This is the Namib in the southwest.

166
00:27:39,534 --> 00:27:42,995
At its heart, a disused diamond mine

167
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,415
that was abandoned nearly 70 years ago.

168
00:27:53,965 --> 00:27:57,760
But it still has one inhabitant.

169
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:08,187
A desert specialist...

170
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:15,903
...and one of Africa's rarest predators.

171
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:24,912
The brown hyena.

172
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:39,260
This ghost town is her home.

173
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:54,775
Its ruins give her valuable protection
from the elements.

174
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:06,579
She has been here for 15 years.

175
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:24,805
She's already reared
nine generations of cubs.

176
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:53,793
These two youngsters have reached
a critical stage in their lives.

177
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:07,765
They're four months old,
and now they need regular solid food.

178
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:13,062
But there is nothing edible
in these ruins,

179
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:15,022
so their mother has to look elsewhere

180
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:19,110
and may leave them
for several days on end.

181
00:30:29,412 --> 00:30:34,917
Brown hyenas may walk over 20 miles a day
in search of food.

182
00:30:44,802 --> 00:30:49,348
This is some of the most hostile country
on the planet.

183
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:25,509
Temperatures reach
a blistering 50 degrees Celsius.

184
00:31:39,857 --> 00:31:42,693
Strong winds blow incessantly.

185
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:58,084
Hyenas from all over the Namib head for
where the sand dunes meet the sea.

186
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,471
Somewhere along

187
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:12,848
this seemingly barren stretch of sand,

188
00:32:12,973 --> 00:32:18,020
there is food in great quantity.

189
00:32:30,783 --> 00:32:33,369
Cape fur seals.

190
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:39,583
There are around 10,000 of them here.

191
00:32:55,391 --> 00:32:57,726
Adult seals are large and strong.

192
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:07,319
But their pups are neither.

193
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:15,953
The youngsters are closely guarded
by their mothers.

194
00:33:17,538 --> 00:33:22,459
A hyena, however, knows to be patient.

195
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:32,428
Sooner or later, seal mothers
must return to the ocean to cool off.

196
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:47,234
A single seal pup could feed a hyena
and her family for days.

197
00:33:52,907 --> 00:33:55,326
But finding food is only half the battle.

198
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:02,791
It now has to be carried back.

199
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,257
A jackal is here too...

200
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:17,097
...and it's not alone.

201
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:29,610
If a hyena loses her kill, she'll have
nothing with which to feed her cubs.

202
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:48,337
The jackals won't follow her
very far from the coast.

203
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,425
It's too hot for them
in the desert interior.

204
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:01,517
Only by making these long journeys

205
00:35:01,642 --> 00:35:06,897
can brown hyenas manage to survive
in the middle of the Namib.

206
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:14,571
But some desert animals
seldom move far.

207
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:20,577
The Kalahari Desert.

208
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:26,709
Here, food is more plentiful...

209
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:30,671
...but it's hidden.

210
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,890
A pangolin.

211
00:35:48,314 --> 00:35:53,319
She can collect food
that others can't reach.

212
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:59,658
A keen sense of smell
enables her to detect

213
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:05,414
the presence of ants and termites
in their nests beneath the sand.

214
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:28,354
Her sticky tongue, some 30cm long,

215
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:32,524
enables her to collect them
from deep underground.

216
00:36:40,908 --> 00:36:43,327
And she's being carefully watched.

217
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:54,171
The drier it gets,
the deeper the termites live.

218
00:36:55,506 --> 00:36:59,843
Many are way beyond the reach
of even a pangolin.

219
00:37:02,054 --> 00:37:04,765
But not of an aardvark.

220
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:13,607
It's the world's largest burrowing animal.

221
00:37:20,531 --> 00:37:23,909
Its sense of smell is extremely acute.

222
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:44,430
Shovel-like claws and powerful legs
enable it to dig down

223
00:37:44,555 --> 00:37:47,433
to depths of five or six metres.

224
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:58,152
A full-grown aardvark needs to eat
about 50,000 termites every day.

225
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:05,826
Termites are highly nutritious
and full of moisture,

226
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:09,830
and they can be collected here year round.

227
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:25,762
Aardvark are usually nocturnal.

228
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:31,393
But the fact that this one
is foraging in daylight

229
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:35,105
is a sign that food is scarce.

230
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:44,072
Recent droughts in the Kalahari
have led to low termite numbers

231
00:38:44,198 --> 00:38:49,411
and, as a consequence,
aardvarks here are close to starvation.

232
00:38:55,292 --> 00:39:00,964
Changes in the world's climate
are affecting many of Africa's animals.

233
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:13,143
It's predicted that in the next century,

234
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:18,023
Southern Africa will warm twice as much
as the global average.

235
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:28,825
The future will be bleak for those
that cannot adapt fast enough.

236
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:41,088
In Zimbabwe,
it hasn't rained in six months.

237
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:54,309
During a drought, food becomes
harder and harder to find.

238
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:21,044
Apple-ring acacias produce pods
that are full of protein...

239
00:40:23,005 --> 00:40:25,799
...but mostly on their higher branches.

240
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:32,848
Six metres up, they're out of reach,

241
00:40:32,973 --> 00:40:37,728
even for the continent's largest animals.

242
00:41:17,434 --> 00:41:23,940
This bull elephant needs to eat
about 90kg of vegetation every day.

243
00:41:40,207 --> 00:41:44,544
He's worked out a remarkable way
of surviving

244
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:47,297
in these lean times.

245
00:41:49,383 --> 00:41:53,011
But it requires great physical strength.

246
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:16,159
Only a handful of bulls
have mastered the skill.

247
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:43,395
He weighs over five tonnes.

248
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,857
This is a truly monumental effort.

249
00:43:25,896 --> 00:43:29,733
Those around him benefit too.

250
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:48,460
Elephants have used their great
intelligence to help them survive

251
00:43:48,585 --> 00:43:51,838
Africa's driest times for millennia.

252
00:43:56,802 --> 00:44:00,847
But today,
they face an even greater threat.

253
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:13,318
It's thought that as many as 20 million
elephants once roamed the continent,

254
00:44:13,443 --> 00:44:17,614
but many have been killed
for their tusks...

255
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:25,121
...their ivory used for entirely
ornamental purposes.

256
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:35,632
Now just 350,000 elephants remain.

257
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:46,601
These stockpiles of confiscated tusks

258
00:44:46,726 --> 00:44:51,356
represent half of the elephants killed
on the continent

259
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:53,775
in just one year.

260
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:09,124
But of all of Africa's remaining wildlife,

261
00:45:09,249 --> 00:45:13,628
it is the rhinoceros that has been
most affected by poaching.

262
00:45:19,593 --> 00:45:24,180
In the Far East, its horn is used
as traditional medicine.

263
00:45:29,686 --> 00:45:33,523
All of Africa's rhinos
are now under threat...

264
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:41,531
...but for one subspecies,
it's likely to be already too late.

265
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:48,955
The northern white rhinoceros
is facing extinction.

266
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:53,710
Scientists are working on a solution,

267
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:59,090
but no male now survives,
so natural breeding is impossible.

268
00:46:04,012 --> 00:46:07,933
These two females
are the last of their kind.

269
00:46:09,142 --> 00:46:11,144
When they die,

270
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:17,776
an entire subspecies that inhabited
the Earth for millions of years

271
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:20,862
will have disappeared for ever.

272
00:46:25,367 --> 00:46:27,994
Right across Africa,

273
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:33,708
human beings are having
a devastating impact on all wildlife.

274
00:46:37,045 --> 00:46:39,214
Cheetah numbers are decreasing

275
00:46:39,339 --> 00:46:40,840
year on year.

276
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:48,181
Today, there are fewer than 8,000
left on the continent.

277
00:47:00,652 --> 00:47:05,323
The global demand for pangolin scales
for use in traditional medicine

278
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:09,953
has now made them
the most trafficked animal on the planet.

279
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:19,087
And western chimpanzees are so threatened
by the loss of their habitat

280
00:47:19,212 --> 00:47:22,424
that they are now critically endangered.

281
00:47:26,386 --> 00:47:28,430
In this female's lifetime,

282
00:47:28,555 --> 00:47:31,599
three-quarters of the forest
in the Ivory Coast

283
00:47:31,725 --> 00:47:34,185
has been felled for plantations.

284
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:43,319
Deforestation -
and not only in Africa -

285
00:47:43,445 --> 00:47:46,656
continues on an enormous scale.

286
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:56,583
64 million acres of forest
are destroyed every year

287
00:47:56,708 --> 00:48:00,378
to make way for agriculture
and industry.

288
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:05,633
An area of forest
the size of a football field

289
00:48:05,759 --> 00:48:07,802
is disappearing every second.

290
00:48:13,808 --> 00:48:17,437
Climate change is affecting
global weather patterns.

291
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:23,318
Rainfall is increasingly unpredictable.

292
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:28,281
Average temperatures
are soaring all over the globe.

293
00:48:35,622 --> 00:48:37,999
Extreme weather
is now affecting wildlife

294
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:41,419
on all seven of the planet's continents.

295
00:48:55,683 --> 00:49:00,897
Today, scientists tell us that
we are at the start of a mass extinction,

296
00:49:01,022 --> 00:49:06,027
and one that is being caused
by human activity.

297
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,909
Over a million species
could be wiped out,

298
00:49:13,034 --> 00:49:16,162
many within the next few decades.

299
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:29,926
But with help, even the most vulnerable
wildlife populations can still recover.

300
00:49:36,057 --> 00:49:39,060
In Africa's Virunga National Park,

301
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:43,773
an intensive conservation programme
for the mountain gorilla

302
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:50,446
has raised their numbers above 1,000
for the first time since records began.

303
00:50:08,131 --> 00:50:10,049
And in Antarctica,

304
00:50:10,175 --> 00:50:14,179
the international ban on whaling
has meant that the great whales

305
00:50:14,304 --> 00:50:19,851
have returned to the Southern Ocean
in numbers not seen for a century.

306
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:26,691
So we can improve things...

307
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:30,737
...if we determine to do so.

308
00:50:35,825 --> 00:50:38,870
This is a crucial moment in time.

309
00:50:38,995 --> 00:50:41,456
The decisions we take now

310
00:50:41,581 --> 00:50:46,753
will influence the future of animals,
humanity,

311
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:51,257
and indeed all life on Earth.
