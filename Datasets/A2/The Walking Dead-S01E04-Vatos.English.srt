1
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:05,422
( birds chirping )

2
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,978
- What?
- Nothing.

3
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:24,190
It's not nothing.
It's always something.

4
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:28,069
Didn't Dad teach you
to tie nail knots?

5
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:31,072
Why would he do that?
He only ever used a fisherman's knot.

6
00:00:35,576 --> 00:00:38,079
- One knot.
- No, he didn't.

7
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,706
No, he tied at least three.

8
00:00:40,873 --> 00:00:42,625
Clinch knots?

9
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,376
No way.

10
00:00:44,543 --> 00:00:46,628
Fine, I'm making it up.

11
00:00:50,674 --> 00:00:53,510
( reel clicking )

12
00:00:57,973 --> 00:01:00,100
Did Dad teach you
mostly dry lures?

13
00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:02,352
Yeah. You?

14
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:05,272
- Wet.
- You're kidding.

15
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,732
But he was always so adamant.

16
00:01:07,899 --> 00:01:09,818
I mean, you know Dad
on the fishing thing.

17
00:01:09,985 --> 00:01:11,485
Gee, you think?

18
00:01:11,652 --> 00:01:14,738
I only spent my entire childhood
with my ass in a boat.

19
00:01:14,905 --> 00:01:17,992
But in my day it was all
about getting the hook seated.

20
00:01:18,158 --> 00:01:20,034
We were fishing
for the dinner table.

21
00:01:20,201 --> 00:01:22,620
Not us.
We always threw them back.

22
00:01:22,787 --> 00:01:24,789
- Always.
- I guess he changed things up.

23
00:01:24,956 --> 00:01:28,084
But that'd be like changing
his religion or something.

24
00:01:28,251 --> 00:01:31,588
People change. It's not his fault
we were born 12 years apart.

25
00:01:31,754 --> 00:01:34,048
No.

26
00:01:34,215 --> 00:01:37,384
No, because the minute
you went off to college

27
00:01:37,551 --> 00:01:40,762
it was my ass in that boat and
he taught me dry lures from day one.

28
00:01:42,514 --> 00:01:45,726
This was not behavior
developed over time.

29
00:01:52,316 --> 00:01:54,318
( reel clicks )

30
00:01:55,652 --> 00:01:57,236
You think he did it for us?

31
00:01:57,403 --> 00:01:59,905
( crying ) Because he knew
we were so different.

32
00:02:02,366 --> 00:02:04,410
( chuckles )

33
00:02:04,577 --> 00:02:08,039
He knew that you needed
to catch the fish

34
00:02:08,205 --> 00:02:10,750
and I needed to throw them back.

35
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,504
( inhales )
All right, remember his rule:

36
00:02:15,671 --> 00:02:17,631
no crying in the boat.

37
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:20,759
It scares the fish.

38
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:23,761
Mom and Dad--

39
00:02:24,803 --> 00:02:26,263
I mean,

40
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,642
maybe Florida wasn't hit so bad.

41
00:02:29,808 --> 00:02:32,728
Maybe it's better there.

42
00:02:32,895 --> 00:02:34,897
Do you think?

43
00:02:37,816 --> 00:02:40,110
( reel clicks, whirrs )

44
00:02:40,277 --> 00:02:42,862
I think you have a bite.

45
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:45,657
Even with the wrong knots.

46
00:02:45,823 --> 00:02:48,660
- ( reel clicking )
- ( sniffles )

47
00:02:48,826 --> 00:02:50,662
Oh God.

48
00:02:50,828 --> 00:02:52,330
( sighs )

49
00:02:52,497 --> 00:02:55,166
So much for the no crying rule.

50
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:58,252
I think that was more
for Dad than the fish.

51
00:03:29,701 --> 00:03:31,869
( shovel scraping )

52
00:03:47,677 --> 00:03:50,304
( theme music playing )

53
00:04:31,637 --> 00:04:33,848
( shouts )

54
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,986
I won't hesitate. I don't care
if every walker in the city hears it.

55
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:04,796 X1:0
You got a do-rag or something?

56
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,101
( sighs )

57
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,482
I guess the saw blade was
too dull for the handcuffs.

58
00:05:26,609 --> 00:05:28,986 X1:0
Ain't that a bitch.

59
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:56,180 X1:0
He must have used a tourniquet--
maybe his belt.

60
00:05:56,347 --> 00:05:58,432 X1:0
Be much more blood
if he didn't.

61
00:06:29,714 --> 00:06:32,550 X1:0
Merle? You in here?

62
00:06:49,984 --> 00:06:52,987
Jim? You okay?

63
00:06:58,868 --> 00:07:02,121
You keep this up,
you're gonna keel over out here.

64
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,170
Drink some water at least.

65
00:07:23,893 --> 00:07:26,062
( growling )

66
00:07:27,605 --> 00:07:28,813
( thuds )

67
00:07:46,456 --> 00:07:50,126
Daryl: Had enough in him
to take out these two sumbitches

68
00:07:51,336 --> 00:07:53,004
one handed.

69
00:07:55,465 --> 00:07:57,676
Toughest asshole
I ever met, my brother.

70
00:07:57,842 --> 00:07:59,302
( grunts )

71
00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:01,638
Feed him a hammer,
he'd crap out nails.

72
00:08:01,805 --> 00:08:03,765
Any man can pass out
from blood loss,

73
00:08:03,932 --> 00:08:06,184
no matter how tough he is.

74
00:08:11,355 --> 00:08:12,898
Morales:
Oh, baby. Will you look at that?

75
00:08:13,065 --> 00:08:15,776
Hey, check it out.
( laughs )

76
00:08:17,903 --> 00:08:19,238
- Ladies...
- ( clapping )

77
00:08:19,405 --> 00:08:22,616
...because of you
my children will eat tonight.

78
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,575
- Thank you.
- Thank Dale.

79
00:08:24,742 --> 00:08:26,661
It's his canoe and gear.

80
00:08:26,828 --> 00:08:28,788
Carl:
Mom, look. Look at all the fish.

81
00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:30,790
Thank you.

82
00:08:30,957 --> 00:08:32,749
- ( chuckles )
- Whoa.

83
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:35,877
Yeah, whoa.
Where did you two learn to do that?

84
00:08:36,044 --> 00:08:38,547
- Our dad.
- Can you teach me how to do that?

85
00:08:38,714 --> 00:08:41,800
Sure. I'll teach you all
about nail knots and stuff.

86
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:44,720
- If that's okay.
- You won't catch me arguing.

87
00:08:44,886 --> 00:08:48,682
Hey, Dale. When's the last time
you oiled those line reels?

88
00:08:48,849 --> 00:08:51,434
- They are a disgrace.
- I, uh--

89
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,560
I don't want to alarm anyone,

90
00:08:53,727 --> 00:08:56,479
but we may have
a bit of a problem.

91
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,372
- Merle!
- We're not alone here.

92
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:16,458
- Remember?
- Screw that.

93
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:19,461
He could be bleeding out.
You said so yourself.

94
00:09:38,772 --> 00:09:40,981
Glenn:
What's that burned stuff?

95
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:43,567
Skin.

96
00:09:43,734 --> 00:09:45,861
He cauterized the stump.

97
00:09:50,074 --> 00:09:51,909
Told you he was tough.

98
00:09:52,076 --> 00:09:53,952
Nobody can kill
Merle but Merle.

99
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:56,914
Don't take that on faith.
He's lost a lot of blood.

100
00:09:57,081 --> 00:09:58,581
Yeah?

101
00:09:58,748 --> 00:10:01,917
Didn't stop him from busting
out of this death trap.

102
00:10:03,085 --> 00:10:04,169
He left the building?

103
00:10:04,336 --> 00:10:05,712
Why the hell would he do that?

104
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:07,171
Daryl:
Why wouldn't he?

105
00:10:07,338 --> 00:10:10,966
He's out there alone
as far as he knows,

106
00:10:11,133 --> 00:10:12,717
doing what he's got to do.

107
00:10:12,884 --> 00:10:15,095
Surviving.

108
00:10:15,261 --> 00:10:17,472
T-Dog:
You call that surviving?

109
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:20,058
Just wandering out in the streets,
maybe passing out?

110
00:10:20,225 --> 00:10:21,851
What are his odds out there?

111
00:10:22,018 --> 00:10:24,979
No worse than being handcuffed
and left to rot by you sorry pricks.

112
00:10:27,273 --> 00:10:28,733
You couldn't kill him.

113
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,487
Ain't so worried about
some dumb dead bastard.

114
00:10:32,654 --> 00:10:34,405
What about 1,000
dumb dead bastards?

115
00:10:34,572 --> 00:10:36,866
- Different story?
- Why don't you take a tally?

116
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:39,244
Do what you want.
I'm gonna go get him.

117
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,538
- Daryl, wait.
- Get your hands off me!

118
00:10:41,704 --> 00:10:43,540
- You can't stop me.
- I don't blame you.

119
00:10:43,706 --> 00:10:46,251
He's family, I get that.
I went through hell to find mine.

120
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:48,169
I know exactly how you feel.

121
00:10:50,255 --> 00:10:51,798
He can't get far
with that injury.

122
00:10:51,965 --> 00:10:53,549
We could help you check
a few blocks around

123
00:10:53,715 --> 00:10:56,426
but only if we keep a level head.

124
00:10:58,637 --> 00:11:00,639
I could do that.

125
00:11:03,183 --> 00:11:05,978
Only if we get those guns first.

126
00:11:06,145 --> 00:11:07,729
I'm not strolling
the streets of Atlanta

127
00:11:07,896 --> 00:11:10,107
with just my good intentions, okay?

128
00:11:30,752 --> 00:11:32,588
Hey, Jim.

129
00:11:34,923 --> 00:11:36,507
Jim, why don't you
hold up, all right?

130
00:11:36,674 --> 00:11:39,302
- Just give me a second here, please.
- What do you want?

131
00:11:39,468 --> 00:11:42,053
We're all just
a little concerned, man. That's all.

132
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,597
Dale says you've been
out here for hours.

133
00:11:44,763 --> 00:11:47,683
- So?
- So why are you digging?

134
00:11:49,602 --> 00:11:51,645
Are you heading to China, Jim?

135
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:54,440
What does it matter?
I'm not hurting anyone.

136
00:11:54,607 --> 00:11:56,025
Yeah, except maybe yourself.

137
00:11:56,192 --> 00:11:59,445
It's 100° today.
You can't keep this up.

138
00:11:59,612 --> 00:12:01,530
Sure I can. Watch me.

139
00:12:01,697 --> 00:12:03,908
Jim, they're not
gonna say it so I will.

140
00:12:04,074 --> 00:12:06,368
You're scaring people.

141
00:12:06,535 --> 00:12:08,996
You're scaring my son
and Carol's daughter.

142
00:12:09,163 --> 00:12:12,499
They got nothing to be scared of.

143
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,377
I mean, what the hell, people?

144
00:12:15,544 --> 00:12:17,420
I'm out here by myself.
Why don't you all just go

145
00:12:17,587 --> 00:12:20,632
and leave me the hell alone?

146
00:12:20,798 --> 00:12:23,843
We think that you need
to take a break, okay?

147
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,346
Why don't you go and get
yourself in the shade?

148
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:28,264
Some food maybe.
I'll tell you what--

149
00:12:28,431 --> 00:12:30,600
maybe in a little bit
I'll come out here

150
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:32,852
and help you myself.

151
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,771
Jim, just tell me what it's about.

152
00:12:34,938 --> 00:12:36,730
Why don't you just go ahead
and give me that shovel?

153
00:12:36,897 --> 00:12:39,191
- Or what?
- There is no or what.

154
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:42,486
I'm asking you. I'm coming to you
and I'm asking you, please.

155
00:12:42,653 --> 00:12:44,196
I don't want to have
to take it from you.

156
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:47,074
And if I don't, then what?

157
00:12:47,241 --> 00:12:49,785
Then you're gonna
beat my face in

158
00:12:49,952 --> 00:12:52,037
like Ed Peletier, aren't you?

159
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:55,581
Y'all seen his face, huh?
What's left of it.

160
00:12:55,748 --> 00:12:58,541
See, now that's what happens
when someone crosses you.

161
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,502
That was different, Jim.

162
00:13:00,669 --> 00:13:03,922
You weren't there. Ed was out
of control. He was hurting his wife.

163
00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:05,548
That is their marriage.
That is not his.

164
00:13:05,715 --> 00:13:09,010
He is not judge and jury.
Who voted you king boss, huh?

165
00:13:09,177 --> 00:13:10,845
Shane: Jim, I'm not here
to argue with you, all right?

166
00:13:11,012 --> 00:13:12,972
- Just give me the shovel, okay?
- No no no.

167
00:13:13,138 --> 00:13:15,808
- Just give me the-- Jim!
- ( grunts )

168
00:13:15,975 --> 00:13:17,767
- Okay, shh shh.
- You got no right!

169
00:13:17,934 --> 00:13:19,518
- Stop. Shh.
- You got no right!

170
00:13:19,685 --> 00:13:21,477
Jim, just stop it.
Hey hey hey hey.

171
00:13:21,644 --> 00:13:23,729
- Don't!
- Jim. Jim, nobody's gonna hurt you.

172
00:13:23,896 --> 00:13:25,648
You hear me? Shh.

173
00:13:25,815 --> 00:13:28,150
Jim, nobody is gonna
hurt you, okay?

174
00:13:28,317 --> 00:13:31,153
That's a lie.
That's the biggest lie there is.

175
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,615
I told that to my wife
and my two boys.

176
00:13:34,782 --> 00:13:38,411
I said it 100 times.
It didn't matter.

177
00:13:38,577 --> 00:13:41,872
They came out of nowhere.
There were dozens of ‘em.

178
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,751
Just pulled ‘em
right out of my hands.

179
00:13:51,132 --> 00:13:52,800
You know, the only reason
I got away was

180
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:55,636
‘cause the dead were
too busy eating my family.

181
00:14:03,811 --> 00:14:05,271
You're not doing this alone.

182
00:14:05,438 --> 00:14:07,606
Daryl: Even I think it's a bad idea
and I don't even like you much.

183
00:14:07,773 --> 00:14:11,235
It's a good idea, okay,
if you just hear me out.

184
00:14:11,402 --> 00:14:13,821
If we go out there in a group,

185
00:14:13,988 --> 00:14:15,823
we're slow, drawing attention.

186
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,783
If I'm alone, I can move fast.

187
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:21,619
Look.

188
00:14:21,786 --> 00:14:24,664
That's the tank, five blocks
from where we are now.

189
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:26,541
That's the bag of guns.

190
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,960
Here's the alley I dragged
you into when we first met.

191
00:14:29,127 --> 00:14:31,129
- That's where Daryl and I will go.
- Why me?

192
00:14:31,296 --> 00:14:33,505
Your crossbow is quieter
than his gun.

193
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:38,844
While Daryl waits here in the alley,

194
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,679
I run up the street,
grab the bag.

195
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:42,306
You got us elsewhere?

196
00:14:42,473 --> 00:14:43,681
Glenn:
You and T-Dog, right.

197
00:14:43,848 --> 00:14:45,683
You'll be in this alley here.

198
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,352
Two blocks away? Why?

199
00:14:47,518 --> 00:14:49,354
I may not be able to
come back the same way.

200
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,356
Walkers might cut me off.

201
00:14:51,522 --> 00:14:53,858
If that happens,
I won't go back to Daryl.

202
00:14:54,025 --> 00:14:55,901
I'll go forward instead,

203
00:14:56,068 --> 00:14:58,320
all the way around to that
alley where you guys are.

204
00:14:58,487 --> 00:15:00,155
Whichever direction I go,

205
00:15:00,322 --> 00:15:03,200
I got you in both places
to cover me.

206
00:15:03,367 --> 00:15:04,867
Afterwards,
we'll all meet back here.

207
00:15:05,034 --> 00:15:07,328
Hey, kid, what'd you do
before all this?

208
00:15:07,495 --> 00:15:11,207
Delivered pizzas. Why?

209
00:15:41,904 --> 00:15:43,780
You got some balls
for a Chinaman.

210
00:15:43,947 --> 00:15:46,491
- I'm Korean.
- Whatever.

211
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:09,055
( growls )

212
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:17,897
Whoa, don't shoot me!
What do you want?

213
00:16:18,064 --> 00:16:20,400
I'm looking for my brother.
He's hurt real bad. You seen him?

214
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:21,775
- Ayúdame!
- Shut up!

215
00:16:21,942 --> 00:16:23,944
You're gonna bring the geeks
down on us. Answer me.

216
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,245
( growling )

217
00:16:35,956 --> 00:16:39,001
- Answer me.
- Ayúdame!

218
00:16:39,168 --> 00:16:40,794
Ayúdame!

219
00:16:42,296 --> 00:16:44,631
Ayúdame!

220
00:16:44,798 --> 00:16:46,967
- Daryl: Shut up. Shut up.
- ( muffled screaming )

221
00:16:47,134 --> 00:16:48,385
Shut up.

222
00:16:49,469 --> 00:16:51,137
Shut up.

223
00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:01,564
That's it. That's the bag, vato.
Take it! Take it!

224
00:17:01,731 --> 00:17:04,108
Ah! Ah!

225
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:07,487
( screams )

226
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:09,613
( car approaches )

227
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,948
Get off me!
Get off me!

228
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,492
Daryl! Daryl!

229
00:17:15,658 --> 00:17:16,826
Daryl!

230
00:17:18,077 --> 00:17:19,829
( tires squealing )

231
00:17:19,996 --> 00:17:21,915
Come back here,

232
00:17:22,081 --> 00:17:23,875
you sumbitches!

233
00:17:29,172 --> 00:17:31,048
( shouts )

234
00:17:31,215 --> 00:17:33,467
Whoa whoa whoa. Stop it.

235
00:17:33,634 --> 00:17:35,302
I'm gonna kick your nuts
up in your throat!

236
00:17:35,469 --> 00:17:36,887
- Let me go.
- Chill out.

237
00:17:37,054 --> 00:17:38,889
They took Glenn.
That little bastard

238
00:17:39,056 --> 00:17:40,432
and his little bastard
homie friends.

239
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:42,142
I'm gonna stomp your ass!

240
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:43,936
Guys! Guys! We're cut off!

241
00:17:44,102 --> 00:17:46,772
Get to the lab. Go.

242
00:17:49,816 --> 00:17:51,610
Come on.
Damn, let's go.

243
00:18:05,165 --> 00:18:07,668
Jim, take some water?

244
00:18:07,834 --> 00:18:09,378
- All right.
- Yeah?

245
00:18:09,545 --> 00:18:11,547
All right.

246
00:18:14,216 --> 00:18:16,425
Here you go, bud.

247
00:18:21,222 --> 00:18:23,182
Pour some on my head?

248
00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:24,976
Yeah.

249
00:18:30,856 --> 00:18:33,150
Cooling you down, huh?

250
00:18:33,317 --> 00:18:35,069
Yeah.

251
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,990
How long you gonna
keep me like this?

252
00:18:41,156 --> 00:18:43,075
Well, yeah.

253
00:18:43,242 --> 00:18:45,077
Until I don't think that
you're a danger to yourself

254
00:18:45,244 --> 00:18:47,621
or others.

255
00:18:54,378 --> 00:18:57,631
Sorry if I scared your boy
and your little girl.

256
00:18:59,591 --> 00:19:01,884
You had sunstroke.
Nobody's blaming you.

257
00:19:02,051 --> 00:19:03,761
You're not scared now, are you?

258
00:19:03,928 --> 00:19:05,304
No sir.

259
00:19:13,103 --> 00:19:16,231
Your mama's right.
Sun just cooked my head is all.

260
00:19:16,398 --> 00:19:19,026
Jim, do you know
why you were digging?

261
00:19:21,235 --> 00:19:22,945
Can you say?

262
00:19:23,112 --> 00:19:25,781
I had a reason.
Don't remember.

263
00:19:28,117 --> 00:19:30,661
Something I dreamt last night.

264
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,167
Your dad was in it.
You were too.

265
00:19:37,334 --> 00:19:39,628
You were worried about him.
Can't remember the rest.

266
00:19:41,796 --> 00:19:43,172
You worried about your dad?

267
00:19:43,339 --> 00:19:46,132
They're not back yet.

268
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:48,301
We don't need
to talk about that.

269
00:19:48,468 --> 00:19:50,011
Your dad's a police officer, son.

270
00:19:50,178 --> 00:19:51,804
He helps people.

271
00:19:51,971 --> 00:19:54,682
Probably just came across
some folks needing help, that's all.

272
00:19:54,849 --> 00:19:57,434
That man,
he is tough as nails.

273
00:19:57,601 --> 00:20:00,562
I don't know him well but...

274
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,398
I could see it in him.

275
00:20:03,565 --> 00:20:04,816
Am I right?

276
00:20:04,983 --> 00:20:07,152
Oh yeah.

277
00:20:10,447 --> 00:20:12,616
There ain't nothing gonna
stop him from getting back here

278
00:20:12,783 --> 00:20:14,868
to you and your mom,
I promise you that.

279
00:20:20,499 --> 00:20:22,125
All right.

280
00:20:22,292 --> 00:20:24,503
Who wants to help me
clean some fish, huh?

281
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,462
Carl:
Sweet. Come on, Sophia.

282
00:20:26,629 --> 00:20:29,173
Lori:
Stay with Carol, all right?

283
00:20:48,818 --> 00:20:50,653
You keep your boy close.

284
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,864
You don't ever let him
out of your sight.

285
00:21:03,624 --> 00:21:06,043
Those men you were with,
we need to know where they went.

286
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:08,086
I ain't telling you nothing.

287
00:21:08,253 --> 00:21:11,214
Jesus, man.
What the hell happened back there?

288
00:21:11,381 --> 00:21:13,633
I told you, this little turd
and his douche bag friends

289
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,384
came out of nowhere
and jumped me.

290
00:21:15,551 --> 00:21:17,427
You're the one
who jumped me, puto,

291
00:21:17,593 --> 00:21:20,263
screaming about trying to find
his brother like it's my damn fault.

292
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,557
They took Glenn.
Could have taken Merle too.

293
00:21:22,724 --> 00:21:25,017
Merle? What kind of
hick name is that?

294
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:27,060
I wouldn't name my dog Merle.

295
00:21:27,227 --> 00:21:29,604
Damn it, Daryl. Back off.

296
00:21:36,653 --> 00:21:39,406
Want to see what happened
to the last guy that pissed me off?

297
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,496
( screams )

298
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,583
Start with the feet this time.

299
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,962
The men you were with
took our friend.

300
00:21:56,129 --> 00:21:57,421
All we want to do
is talk to them,

301
00:21:57,588 --> 00:21:59,047
see if we can work
something out.

302
00:22:05,804 --> 00:22:07,639
( rattles )

303
00:22:07,806 --> 00:22:09,266
You sure you're up for this?

304
00:22:09,433 --> 00:22:11,727
- Yeah.
- Okay.

305
00:22:15,063 --> 00:22:16,607
One wrong move,

306
00:22:16,774 --> 00:22:18,650
you get an arrow in the ass.
Just so you know.

307
00:22:18,817 --> 00:22:20,819
G's gonna take that
arrow out of my ass

308
00:22:20,986 --> 00:22:23,447
and shove it up yours.
Just so you know.

309
00:22:23,614 --> 00:22:26,116
- G?
- Guillermo.

310
00:22:26,283 --> 00:22:27,743
He's the man here.

311
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,118
Okay then.

312
00:22:29,285 --> 00:22:31,621
- ( cocks gun )
- Let's go see Guillermo.

313
00:23:10,993 --> 00:23:13,538
- ( lock clacks )
- ( doors creaking )

314
00:23:23,172 --> 00:23:25,007
You okay, little man?

315
00:23:25,174 --> 00:23:28,177
They're gonna cut off
my feet, carnal.

316
00:23:28,344 --> 00:23:29,846
Cops do that?

317
00:23:30,012 --> 00:23:32,849
Not him. This redneck puto here.

318
00:23:33,015 --> 00:23:34,975
He cut off some dude's hand, man.
He showed it to me.

319
00:23:35,141 --> 00:23:37,853
- Shut up.
- Hey, that's that vato right there.

320
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:40,146
He shot me in the ass with an arrow.
What's up, homes, huh?

321
00:23:40,313 --> 00:23:42,482
Chill, ese, chill. Chill.

322
00:23:44,442 --> 00:23:45,818
This true?

323
00:23:45,985 --> 00:23:48,237
He wants Miguelito's feet?

324
00:23:48,404 --> 00:23:49,738
That's pretty sick, man.

325
00:23:49,905 --> 00:23:52,700
We were hoping more
for a calm discussion.

326
00:23:52,867 --> 00:23:54,535
That hillbilly jumps
Felipe's little cousin,

327
00:23:54,702 --> 00:23:56,036
beats on him,
threatens to cut off his feet,

328
00:23:56,203 --> 00:23:57,621
Felipe gets an arrow in the ass

329
00:23:57,788 --> 00:24:00,207
and you want a calm discussion?

330
00:24:00,374 --> 00:24:02,751
You fascinate me.

331
00:24:02,918 --> 00:24:04,461
Heat of the moment.

332
00:24:04,628 --> 00:24:07,548
Mistakes were made on both sides.

333
00:24:09,884 --> 00:24:11,760
Who's that dude to you anyway?
You don't look related.

334
00:24:11,927 --> 00:24:14,680
He's one of our group, more or less.

335
00:24:14,847 --> 00:24:16,891
I'm sure you have a few like him.

336
00:24:17,057 --> 00:24:19,184
Daryl:
You got my brother in there?

337
00:24:19,351 --> 00:24:21,728
Guillermo:
Sorry, we're fresh out of white boys.

338
00:24:21,895 --> 00:24:24,063
But I've got Asian.
You interested?

339
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,774
I have one of yours,
you have one of mine.

340
00:24:26,941 --> 00:24:28,943
Sounds like an even trade.

341
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:32,155
- Don't sound even to me.
- G.

342
00:24:32,322 --> 00:24:34,407
- Come on, man.
- Guillermo: My people got attacked.

343
00:24:34,574 --> 00:24:36,576
Where's the compensation
for their pain and suffering?

344
00:24:36,743 --> 00:24:38,912
More to the point,
where's my bag of guns?

345
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:41,706
- Guns?
- The bag Miguel saw in the street.

346
00:24:41,873 --> 00:24:43,583
The bag Felipe and Jorge
were going back to get.

347
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,585
- That bag of guns.
- You're mistaken.

348
00:24:45,752 --> 00:24:47,921
- I don't think so.
- Rick: About it being yours.

349
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:50,423
It's my bag of guns.

350
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,382
The bag was in the street.

351
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:54,593
Anybody could come around
and say it was theirs.

352
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,763
I'm supposed to take your word?

353
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,640
What's to stop my people
from unloading on you

354
00:24:59,806 --> 00:25:01,642
right here and now
and I take what's mine?

355
00:25:04,227 --> 00:25:06,146
You could do that.

356
00:25:07,898 --> 00:25:09,441
Or not.

357
00:25:11,735 --> 00:25:15,030
Come on, man. Make the trade.

358
00:25:15,197 --> 00:25:17,073
Please.

359
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:20,451
Oye.

360
00:25:26,415 --> 00:25:28,626
( whimpers )

361
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:36,133
Guillermo:
I see two options.

362
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,677
You come back with Miguel
and my bag of guns,

363
00:25:38,843 --> 00:25:40,427
everybody walks.

364
00:25:40,594 --> 00:25:42,638
Or you come back
locked and loaded,

365
00:25:42,805 --> 00:25:45,014
we'll see which side
spills more blood.

366
00:25:57,527 --> 00:25:59,529
( clacking )

367
00:26:06,661 --> 00:26:08,121
Them guns are worth
more than gold.

368
00:26:08,287 --> 00:26:12,083
Gold won't protect your family
or put food on the table.

369
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,834
You willing to give that up
for that kid?

370
00:26:15,418 --> 00:26:17,420
T-Dog: If I knew we'd get
Glenn back, I might agree.

371
00:26:17,586 --> 00:26:20,047
But you think that vato across the way
is just gonna hand him over?

372
00:26:20,214 --> 00:26:22,258
- You calling G a liar?
- Are you a part of this?

373
00:26:22,425 --> 00:26:24,510
You want to hold onto your teeth?

374
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:29,181
Question is,
do you trust that man's word?

375
00:26:29,348 --> 00:26:31,475
Daryl: No, question is
what are you willing to bet on it?

376
00:26:31,642 --> 00:26:34,227
Could be more than them guns.
Could be your life.

377
00:26:34,394 --> 00:26:36,438
Glenn worth that to you?

378
00:26:38,732 --> 00:26:41,234
What life I have I owe to him.

379
00:26:41,401 --> 00:26:42,985
I was nobody to Glenn,

380
00:26:43,152 --> 00:26:45,863
just some idiot stuck in a tank.

381
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,115
He could have walked away,
but he didn't.

382
00:26:48,282 --> 00:26:49,658
Neither will I.

383
00:26:49,825 --> 00:26:51,325
So you're gonna hand
the guns over?

384
00:26:52,452 --> 00:26:53,952
I didn't say that.

385
00:26:56,705 --> 00:26:58,248
There's nothing keeping you two here.

386
00:26:58,415 --> 00:27:00,375
You should get out,
head back to camp.

387
00:27:00,542 --> 00:27:02,085
And tell your family what?

388
00:27:14,764 --> 00:27:17,058
Come on, this is nuts.

389
00:27:21,437 --> 00:27:23,229
Just do like G says.

390
00:27:36,743 --> 00:27:38,745
( door clacking )

391
00:27:54,469 --> 00:27:57,722
I see my guns
but they're not all in the bag.

392
00:27:57,889 --> 00:27:59,599
That's because they're not yours.

393
00:27:59,766 --> 00:28:01,392
I thought I mentioned that.

394
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:03,394
Let's just shoot
these fools right now, ese.

395
00:28:03,561 --> 00:28:05,063
All right?
Unload on their asses, ese.

396
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:08,858
I don't think you fully appreciate
the gravity of the situation.

397
00:28:09,025 --> 00:28:10,944
No, I'm pretty clear.

398
00:28:13,613 --> 00:28:17,450
You have your man.
I want mine.

399
00:28:20,286 --> 00:28:23,414
I'm gonna chop up your boy.
I'm gonna feed him to my dogs.

400
00:28:23,581 --> 00:28:26,501
They're the evilest, nastiest
man-eating bitches you ever saw.

401
00:28:26,668 --> 00:28:28,628
I picked them up
from Satan at a yard sale.

402
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,964
I told you how it has to be.
Are you woefully deaf?

403
00:28:32,131 --> 00:28:35,008
No, my hearing's fine.
You said come locked and loaded.

404
00:28:37,511 --> 00:28:39,638
Okay then, we're here.

405
00:28:45,602 --> 00:28:48,814
Woman:
Felipe! Felipe!

406
00:28:49,982 --> 00:28:54,236
Abuela, go back
with the others-- now.

407
00:28:54,403 --> 00:28:55,571
Get that old lady out
of the line of fire!

408
00:28:55,737 --> 00:28:58,073
Abuela, listen to your m'hijo, okay?

409
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,740
This is the not the place
for you right now.

410
00:28:59,907 --> 00:29:02,994
Mr. Gilbert is having
trouble breathing.

411
00:29:03,161 --> 00:29:05,746
He needs his asthma stuff.

412
00:29:05,913 --> 00:29:07,373
Carlito didn't find it.

413
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,834
He needs his medicine.

414
00:29:13,045 --> 00:29:14,505
Felipe, go take care of it, okay?

415
00:29:14,672 --> 00:29:16,048
And take your
grandmother with you.

416
00:29:16,215 --> 00:29:18,050
( Felipe speaks Spanish )

417
00:29:18,217 --> 00:29:20,761
Who are those men?

418
00:29:20,928 --> 00:29:23,513
- ( Felipe speaks Spanish )
- Don't you take him.

419
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,765
- Ma'am?
- Felipe's a good boy.

420
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:29,019
He have his trouble
but he pull himself together.

421
00:29:29,186 --> 00:29:31,979
We need him here.

422
00:29:32,146 --> 00:29:34,355
Ma'am,

423
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,774
I'm not here to arrest
your grandson.

424
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,776
Then what do you want him for?

425
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,779
He's...

426
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,948
helping us find a missing person.

427
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,491
Fella named Glenn.

428
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:48,077
The Asian boy?

429
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:50,538
He's with Mr. Gilbert.

430
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:53,874
Come. Come, I show you.

431
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:56,250
He needs his medicine.

432
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,045
Let ‘em pass.

433
00:30:22,109 --> 00:30:24,111
- ( man coughing )
- ( people whispering )

434
00:30:28,616 --> 00:30:31,035
Abuela, por favor.
Take me to him.

435
00:30:43,256 --> 00:30:45,258
( people coughing )

436
00:31:03,276 --> 00:31:04,776
All right. All right.

437
00:31:04,943 --> 00:31:07,445
Nice and easy. Just breathe.

438
00:31:07,612 --> 00:31:09,656
Just breathe. Just let it out.
Just breathe.

439
00:31:09,823 --> 00:31:11,825
( inhaler hisses )

440
00:31:13,117 --> 00:31:14,493
Woman:
Just relax.

441
00:31:15,869 --> 00:31:18,330
- What the hell is this?
- An asthma attack.

442
00:31:18,497 --> 00:31:20,457
Couldn't get his breath
all of a sudden.

443
00:31:20,624 --> 00:31:23,168
I thought you were being
eaten by dogs, man.

444
00:31:24,628 --> 00:31:27,589
( barks )

445
00:31:27,756 --> 00:31:30,634
Could I have a word with you?

446
00:31:30,801 --> 00:31:33,345
You're the dumbest
son of a bitch I ever met.

447
00:31:33,512 --> 00:31:36,307
We walked in there ready
to kill every last one of you.

448
00:31:36,473 --> 00:31:38,267
Well, I'm glad
it didn't go down that way.

449
00:31:38,434 --> 00:31:42,646
If it had, that blood
would be on my hands.

450
00:31:42,813 --> 00:31:44,857
Mine too.
We'd have fought back.

451
00:31:45,024 --> 00:31:46,734
Wouldn't be
the first time we've had to.

452
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:50,487
Protect the food, the medicine--
what's left of it.

453
00:31:50,654 --> 00:31:52,530
These people, the old ones--

454
00:31:52,697 --> 00:31:55,199
the staff took off,
just left ‘em here to die.

455
00:32:00,204 --> 00:32:03,165
Me and Felipe were
the only ones who stayed.

456
00:32:03,332 --> 00:32:06,543
What are you, doctors?

457
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:10,213
Felipe's a nurse--
a special care provider.

458
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,841
Me,

459
00:32:13,008 --> 00:32:15,677
I'm the custodian.

460
00:32:27,481 --> 00:32:29,357
What about the rest of your crew?

461
00:32:29,523 --> 00:32:31,525
The vatos trickle in

462
00:32:31,692 --> 00:32:33,861
to check on their parents,
their grandparents.

463
00:32:34,028 --> 00:32:36,989
They see how things are
and most decide to stay.

464
00:32:37,156 --> 00:32:40,034
It's a good thing too.
We need the muscle.

465
00:32:40,201 --> 00:32:43,496
The people we've encountered
since things fell apart,

466
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:46,332
the worst kind-- plunderers,

467
00:32:46,499 --> 00:32:48,375
the kind that take by force.

468
00:32:48,541 --> 00:32:51,252
- That's not who we are.
- Guillermo: How was I to know?

469
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:54,506
My people got attacked and you
show up with Miguel hostage--

470
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:57,049
appearances.

471
00:32:57,216 --> 00:32:59,676
Guess the world changed.

472
00:32:59,843 --> 00:33:01,887
Guillermo: No.

473
00:33:02,054 --> 00:33:05,223
It's the same as it ever was.
The weak get taken.

474
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,435
So we do what we can here.

475
00:33:09,602 --> 00:33:11,604
The vatos work on those cars,

476
00:33:11,771 --> 00:33:13,563
talk about getting
the old people out of the city.

477
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,857
But most can't even get to
the bathroom by themselves,

478
00:33:16,024 --> 00:33:17,859
so that's just a dream.

479
00:33:18,026 --> 00:33:20,028
Still, it keeps the crew busy,

480
00:33:20,195 --> 00:33:22,071
and that's worth something.

481
00:33:23,531 --> 00:33:25,199
So we barred all the windows,

482
00:33:25,366 --> 00:33:27,535
welded all the doors shut
except for one entrance.

483
00:33:27,701 --> 00:33:29,077
The vatos, they go out,

484
00:33:29,244 --> 00:33:31,579
scavenge what they can
to keep us going.

485
00:33:31,746 --> 00:33:35,417
We watch the perimeter
night and day and we wait.

486
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,963
The people here,

487
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:43,507
they all look to me now.

488
00:33:43,674 --> 00:33:46,218
I don't even know why.

489
00:33:47,928 --> 00:33:49,930
Because they can.

490
00:34:10,826 --> 00:34:13,495
Glenn: Admit it, you only came back
to Atlanta for the hat.

491
00:34:13,662 --> 00:34:15,205
Rick:
Don't tell anybody.

492
00:34:15,372 --> 00:34:17,207
Daryl: You've given away
half our guns and ammo.

493
00:34:17,374 --> 00:34:19,418
- Rick: Not nearly half.
- Daryl: For what?

494
00:34:19,585 --> 00:34:21,587
Bunch of old farts who are
gonna die off momentarily anyhow?

495
00:34:21,753 --> 00:34:23,797
Seriously,
how long you think they got?

496
00:34:23,964 --> 00:34:26,800
How long do any of us?

497
00:34:29,761 --> 00:34:32,431
- Glenn: Oh my God.
- Where the hell's our van?

498
00:34:32,598 --> 00:34:33,640
We left it right there.
Who would take it?

499
00:34:33,807 --> 00:34:34,975
Merle.

500
00:34:37,603 --> 00:34:40,147
He's gonna be taking
some vengeance back to camp.

501
00:34:51,241 --> 00:34:53,660
Wrapping paper,
color tissue, anything?

502
00:34:53,827 --> 00:34:55,162
Dale:
Seriously?

503
00:34:55,329 --> 00:34:56,872
How can you not have any?

504
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:00,501
Had I been informed of the impending
apocalypse I'd have stocked up.

505
00:35:00,667 --> 00:35:03,170
It's Amy's birthday tomorrow.

506
00:35:03,337 --> 00:35:06,465
I've been marking days
on the calendar just to make sure.

507
00:35:09,634 --> 00:35:11,344
You don't give a gift unwrapped.

508
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:15,305
Deep breath.

509
00:35:15,472 --> 00:35:18,057
I'm sure I'll find something here.

510
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,483
I, uh, built up
the rocks all around.

511
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:30,652
See? So the flames can
be a little higher

512
00:35:30,818 --> 00:35:32,194
and have ‘em be hidden.

513
00:35:35,781 --> 00:35:37,365
Hey, Jim.
How you feeling, man?

514
00:35:37,532 --> 00:35:40,576
I'm better.
More myself now.

515
00:35:40,743 --> 00:35:42,787
I hope you understand
the need for this--

516
00:35:42,954 --> 00:35:44,997
this timeout.

517
00:35:45,164 --> 00:35:47,667
I've got others
I've got to think about.

518
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:50,461
I just want to
make sure there's no--

519
00:35:50,628 --> 00:35:52,380
there's no hard feelings.

520
00:35:52,547 --> 00:35:55,049
There's not. I do understand.

521
00:35:55,216 --> 00:35:57,510
Okay.
( chuckles )

522
00:35:57,677 --> 00:36:00,054
Why don't you come
join in with the rest of us?

523
00:36:00,221 --> 00:36:02,223
Big ol' fish fry.

524
00:36:04,475 --> 00:36:07,060
- I'd like that very much.
- Shane: Okay.

525
00:36:07,227 --> 00:36:10,396
( plastic rustles )

526
00:36:10,563 --> 00:36:12,231
Why don't you come outside
with everybody?

527
00:36:12,398 --> 00:36:14,858
Hell with them people.

528
00:36:15,025 --> 00:36:17,152
Wouldn't piss on them
if their heads was on fire.

529
00:36:18,696 --> 00:36:20,114
Hey!

530
00:36:20,281 --> 00:36:22,490
Why don't you stay here?

531
00:36:22,657 --> 00:36:23,908
Keep your daddy company.

532
00:36:25,618 --> 00:36:29,080
Ed, she wants to join in.

533
00:36:29,247 --> 00:36:31,832
- Come on.
- Ed: Fine.

534
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:33,667
Hell with the both of you.

535
00:36:33,834 --> 00:36:36,169
Ain't no need to be bothering me
no more the rest of the night.

536
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:41,633
( all panting )

537
00:36:45,971 --> 00:36:48,932
- ( people laugh )
- Sophia: Pass the fish, please.

538
00:36:49,099 --> 00:36:52,436
- Carol: Here you go.
- Shane: Man o man, that's good.

539
00:36:52,603 --> 00:36:54,855
Whew.
( chuckles )

540
00:36:55,022 --> 00:36:57,024
I miss this.

541
00:37:07,242 --> 00:37:10,078
I've got to ask you, man.
It's been driving me crazy.

542
00:37:10,245 --> 00:37:12,289
- Dale: What?
- That watch.

543
00:37:14,291 --> 00:37:15,917
What's wrong with my watch?

544
00:37:16,084 --> 00:37:19,045
I see you every day,
the same time,

545
00:37:19,211 --> 00:37:21,588
winding that thing

546
00:37:21,755 --> 00:37:23,465
like a village priest saying mass.

547
00:37:23,632 --> 00:37:25,717
I've wondered this myself.

548
00:37:25,884 --> 00:37:28,677
- I'm missing the point.
- Jacqui: Unless I've misread the signs,

549
00:37:28,844 --> 00:37:31,972
the world seems to
have come to an end.

550
00:37:32,139 --> 00:37:34,642
At least hit a speed bump
for a good long while.

551
00:37:34,808 --> 00:37:37,936
But there's you every day
winding that stupid watch.

552
00:37:38,103 --> 00:37:41,815
Time-- it's important
to keep track, isn't it?

553
00:37:41,982 --> 00:37:44,234
The days at least.

554
00:37:44,401 --> 00:37:45,819
Don't you think, Andrea?

555
00:37:45,986 --> 00:37:48,030
- Back me up here.
- ( chuckles )

556
00:37:52,785 --> 00:37:55,204
I like-- I like what, um,

557
00:37:55,371 --> 00:37:59,124
a father said to son
when he gave him a watch

558
00:37:59,291 --> 00:38:03,044
that had been handed down
through generations.

559
00:38:03,211 --> 00:38:05,505
He said,

560
00:38:05,672 --> 00:38:09,676
"I give you the mausoleum

561
00:38:09,842 --> 00:38:12,427
of all hope and desire,

562
00:38:12,594 --> 00:38:15,971
which will fit
your individual needs

563
00:38:16,138 --> 00:38:19,850
no better than it did mine
or my father's before me;

564
00:38:20,017 --> 00:38:22,019
I give it to you

565
00:38:22,186 --> 00:38:26,273
not that you may remember time,

566
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,236
but that you may forget it
for a moment

567
00:38:30,403 --> 00:38:32,905
now and then

568
00:38:33,072 --> 00:38:37,326
and not spend all of your breath
trying to conquer it."

569
00:38:46,711 --> 00:38:48,337
You are so weird.

570
00:38:48,504 --> 00:38:49,672
( all laugh )

571
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:51,882
It's not me. It's Faulkner.

572
00:38:52,049 --> 00:38:55,553
William Faulkner.
Maybe my bad paraphrasing.

573
00:39:02,226 --> 00:39:04,729
- Where are you going?
- I have to pee.

574
00:39:04,895 --> 00:39:07,732
Jeez, you try to be
discreet around here--

575
00:39:07,898 --> 00:39:11,193
( laughs )

576
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,904
( rustling )

577
00:39:14,071 --> 00:39:16,907
Thought I told y'all to leave
me the hell alone, didn't I?

578
00:39:19,744 --> 00:39:21,620
Hey!

579
00:39:23,748 --> 00:39:26,250
- What'd I say?
- ( growling )

580
00:39:26,417 --> 00:39:27,752
Oh!

581
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,088
We're out of toilet paper?

582
00:39:31,255 --> 00:39:33,090
( growling )

583
00:39:37,386 --> 00:39:39,138
( gasps, screaming )

584
00:39:45,144 --> 00:39:46,604
( people screaming )

585
00:39:46,771 --> 00:39:49,648
- Carl: Mom!
- Lori: Carl!

586
00:39:51,442 --> 00:39:53,778
Lori, get him down!

587
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:00,701
- ( guns firing )
- Oh my God.

588
00:40:00,868 --> 00:40:02,328
T-Dog: Go! Go!

589
00:40:02,495 --> 00:40:04,830
( woman, children screaming )

590
00:40:16,801 --> 00:40:18,511
Lori: I'm right here.
Shane, what do we do?

591
00:40:18,677 --> 00:40:21,013
- Shane?
- Follow me!

592
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,349
( screaming )

593
00:40:26,101 --> 00:40:28,478
No! No!

594
00:40:31,647 --> 00:40:33,816
Oh! Oh!

595
00:40:33,982 --> 00:40:35,818
Oh God!
Oh my God!

596
00:40:35,984 --> 00:40:38,821
( groans )
Help me.

597
00:40:38,987 --> 00:40:41,114
Oh God, I don't know what to do.

598
00:40:41,281 --> 00:40:42,533
I don't know what to do.

599
00:40:42,699 --> 00:40:45,619
( crying )

600
00:40:45,786 --> 00:40:47,662
- Come on. Come on, stay close.
- Carol!

601
00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:49,288
Shane:
Stay close!

602
00:40:49,455 --> 00:40:51,999
( screaming )

603
00:40:58,673 --> 00:41:01,300
Come on, y'all!
Work your way up here!

604
00:41:01,467 --> 00:41:03,553
Lori:
Right in front of you. Shane!

605
00:41:04,554 --> 00:41:07,181
Morales:
Get to the RV! Go!

606
00:41:07,348 --> 00:41:10,017
- Lori: Shane! Shane!
- Shane: Stay with me.

607
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:15,397
Stay behind me.
Morales, work up here!

608
00:41:15,564 --> 00:41:18,400
- Lori: Get behind me! Come on!
- Shane: Let's go!

609
00:41:18,567 --> 00:41:20,151
- ( girl screaming )
- Lori: Stay with me.

610
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:22,654
Shane: Come on, make your way
to the Winnebago!

611
00:41:22,821 --> 00:41:25,699
- ( gunshots )
- ( shouting )

612
00:41:44,634 --> 00:41:47,429
Baby! Carl!

613
00:41:47,596 --> 00:41:48,680
Baby!

614
00:41:48,847 --> 00:41:50,557
- Dad!
- Carl!

615
00:41:50,724 --> 00:41:54,311
( crying )

616
00:42:06,364 --> 00:42:09,075
( panting )

617
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:13,413
( sobbing )

618
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,872
Shh shh shh.

619
00:42:19,919 --> 00:42:21,378
Oh, Amy.

620
00:42:23,046 --> 00:42:24,922
( gags )

621
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:33,055
I don't know what to do, Amy.

622
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:16,473
Oh. Oh.

623
00:43:17,474 --> 00:43:19,142
Oh.

624
00:43:20,143 --> 00:43:21,603
Oh.

625
00:43:23,355 --> 00:43:26,775
Oh. Oh.

626
00:43:29,653 --> 00:43:31,321
Oh, Amy.

627
00:43:32,322 --> 00:43:34,658
( crying )

628
00:43:45,752 --> 00:43:48,839
Oh no no.

629
00:43:51,174 --> 00:43:53,343
Amy!

630
00:43:54,678 --> 00:43:56,346
( wailing ) Amy!

631
00:43:56,513 --> 00:43:58,849
Amy!

632
00:43:59,016 --> 00:44:01,184
I remember my dream now,

633
00:44:01,351 --> 00:44:03,979
why I dug the holes.

634
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:20,912
( music playing )
