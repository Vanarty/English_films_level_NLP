1
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:05,171
( bugs chittering )

2
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:28,861
( brakes squeak )

3
00:00:30,696 --> 00:00:34,158
- ( engine stops )
- ( trunk clicks )

4
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:39,956
( bird cawing )

5
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,553
( birds chirping )

6
00:02:12,381 --> 00:02:14,383
( flies buzzing )

7
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,641
( metal rattling )

8
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,792
( shuffling footsteps )

9
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,210
Little girl?

10
00:03:32,461 --> 00:03:34,337
I'm a policeman.

11
00:03:34,504 --> 00:03:36,589
Little girl.

12
00:03:40,552 --> 00:03:42,721
Don't be afraid, okay?

13
00:03:45,514 --> 00:03:47,390
Little girl.

14
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:58,401
( panting )

15
00:03:59,736 --> 00:04:01,738
( growling )

16
00:04:06,325 --> 00:04:08,077
Oh my God.

17
00:04:19,881 --> 00:04:22,884
( theme music playing )

18
00:04:59,796 --> 00:04:59,921
- ( police radio chatter )
- Man: What's the difference

19
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:01,631
- ( police radio chatter )
- Man: What's the difference

20
00:05:01,798 --> 00:05:03,006
between men and women?

21
00:05:03,173 --> 00:05:05,509
- Man #2: This a joke?
- No, I'm serious.

22
00:05:06,843 --> 00:05:09,596
Man #2: I never met a woman
who knew how to turn off a light.

23
00:05:09,763 --> 00:05:11,723
They're born thinking
the switch only goes one way--

24
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,059
- on.
- ( mutters )

25
00:05:14,226 --> 00:05:16,645
They're struck blind
the second they leave a room.

26
00:05:16,812 --> 00:05:18,980
I mean every woman
I ever let have a key--

27
00:05:19,147 --> 00:05:22,192
I swear to God,
it's like I come home,

28
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:25,070
house all lit up.
( chuckles )

29
00:05:25,237 --> 00:05:27,072
And my job,
you see, apparently--

30
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:29,741
because my chromosomes
happen to be different--

31
00:05:29,908 --> 00:05:31,660
is I've then gotta walk
through that house,

32
00:05:31,827 --> 00:05:34,412
turn off every single light
this chick left on.

33
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:37,332
- Is that right?
- Yeah, baby. Mmm.

34
00:05:37,499 --> 00:05:39,501
Oh, Reverend Shane is
preaching to you now, boy.

35
00:05:39,668 --> 00:05:41,503
( both laugh )

36
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,005
Then-- the same chick, mind you--

37
00:05:44,172 --> 00:05:47,092
she'll bitch about global warming.

38
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:49,928
You see, this is-- this is
when Reverend Shane wants

39
00:05:50,095 --> 00:05:52,680
to quote from
the guy gospel and say,

40
00:05:52,847 --> 00:05:57,017
"Darling, maybe you and every other
pair of boobs on this planet

41
00:05:57,184 --> 00:06:00,353
just figure out the light switch,
you see, goes both ways,

42
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,313
maybe we wouldn't have so much
global warming." You know?

43
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,190
- You say that?
- Mmm.

44
00:06:05,357 --> 00:06:08,277
Yeah, well, a polite version.
( laughs )

45
00:06:08,443 --> 00:06:11,947
Still, man, that earns me this look

46
00:06:12,114 --> 00:06:14,116
of loathing you would not believe.

47
00:06:14,283 --> 00:06:16,535
And that's when
the "Exorcist" voice pops out.

48
00:06:16,702 --> 00:06:19,621
( deep voice )
"You sound just like my damn father!

49
00:06:19,788 --> 00:06:22,499
Always yelling
about the power bill,

50
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:24,209
telling me to turn off
the damn lights!"

51
00:06:24,376 --> 00:06:27,045
- And what do you say to that?
- I know what I want to say.

52
00:06:27,212 --> 00:06:28,880
I want to say,
"Bitch, you mean to tell me

53
00:06:29,046 --> 00:06:30,548
you've been hearing this
your entire life

54
00:06:30,715 --> 00:06:33,300
and you are still too damn stupid
to learn how to turn off a switch?"

55
00:06:33,466 --> 00:06:35,510
( both laugh )

56
00:06:35,677 --> 00:06:39,014
You know, I--
I don't actually say that though.

57
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,891
- That would be bad.
- Right right.

58
00:06:41,057 --> 00:06:43,602
Yeah, I go with the--
I go with the polite version there too.

59
00:06:43,768 --> 00:06:45,604
- Very wise.
- Yes sir.

60
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,564
- Mm-hmm.
- Well.

61
00:06:51,026 --> 00:06:53,320
So how's it with Lori, man?

62
00:06:53,486 --> 00:06:56,239
She's good-- she's good
at turning off lights.

63
00:06:56,406 --> 00:06:59,367
Really good. I'm the one
who sometimes forgets.

64
00:06:59,534 --> 00:07:01,536
Not what I meant.

65
00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:07,416
- We didn't have a great night.
- Hey look, man,

66
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:10,461
I may have failed
to amuse with my sermon,

67
00:07:10,628 --> 00:07:12,504
but I did try.

68
00:07:12,671 --> 00:07:15,215
The least you can
do is-- is speak.

69
00:07:16,342 --> 00:07:18,260
That's-- that's what
she always says.

70
00:07:18,427 --> 00:07:22,097
"Speak. Speak."

71
00:07:22,264 --> 00:07:25,559
You'd think I was the most
closed-mouth son of a bitch ever

72
00:07:25,726 --> 00:07:27,436
to hear her tell it.

73
00:07:29,312 --> 00:07:31,188
Do you express your thoughts?

74
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:34,775
Do you share your feelings,
that kind of stuff?

75
00:07:37,027 --> 00:07:39,071
The thing is--

76
00:07:40,571 --> 00:07:42,698
lately, whenever I try,

77
00:07:42,865 --> 00:07:46,160
everything I say
makes her impatient,

78
00:07:46,327 --> 00:07:48,287
like she didn't want
to hear it after all.

79
00:07:49,538 --> 00:07:51,290
It's like she's...

80
00:07:51,457 --> 00:07:54,250
pissed at me all the time
and I don't know why.

81
00:07:55,834 --> 00:07:57,962
Look, man. That's just shit
couples go through.

82
00:07:58,128 --> 00:08:00,297
Yeah, it's a phase.

83
00:08:05,094 --> 00:08:06,804
The last thing
she said this morning,

84
00:08:06,971 --> 00:08:10,724
"Sometimes I wonder
if you even care about us at all."

85
00:08:12,851 --> 00:08:15,896
She said that
in front of our kid.

86
00:08:17,523 --> 00:08:19,692
Imagine going to school
with that in your head.

87
00:08:23,487 --> 00:08:25,489
The difference
between men and women?

88
00:08:27,825 --> 00:08:30,536
I would never say something
that cruel to her...

89
00:08:30,703 --> 00:08:32,997
and certainly not
in front of Carl.

90
00:08:37,167 --> 00:08:38,168
( radio beeps )

91
00:08:38,335 --> 00:08:40,003
Dispatcher:
All available units,

92
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:41,504
high-speed pursuit in progress.

93
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:43,798
Linden County units
request local assistance.

94
00:08:43,965 --> 00:08:46,676
Highway 18 eastbound. GTA, ADW,

95
00:08:46,843 --> 00:08:49,679
2-17, 2-4-3.
Advise extreme caution.

96
00:08:49,846 --> 00:08:52,265
- ( engine starts )
- ( siren blaring )

97
00:09:02,859 --> 00:09:04,694 X1:0
Dispatcher:
Suspects are two male Caucasians.

98
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:07,155 X1:0
Be advised they have fired
upon police officers.

99
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:09,197 X1:0
One Linden County officer
is wounded.

100
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,372 X1:0
( tires screeching )

101
00:09:19,207 --> 00:09:22,085 X1:0
Dispatcher:
Unit 1, unit 3, to eastbound Route 18,

102
00:09:22,252 --> 00:09:24,046 X1:0
two miles west of Interstate 85.

103
00:09:24,212 --> 00:09:26,631 X1:0
Will patch in
Linden County sheriff radio.

104
00:09:26,798 --> 00:09:28,216 X1:0
Man over radio:
Roger that. We're five minutes south

105
00:09:28,383 --> 00:09:30,635 X1:0
of the Route 18 intersection.

106
00:09:30,802 --> 00:09:32,721 X1:0
Man #2 over radio:
Dispatch, unit 1 and unit 3,

107
00:09:32,888 --> 00:09:35,015 X1:0
we are 10-97 and code 100,

108
00:09:35,182 --> 00:09:37,767 X1:0
Highway 18,
E.B. of interstate, please advise.

109
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,729 X1:0
Man on radio: 10-9,
we just got word from Linden County

110
00:09:41,896 --> 00:09:43,564 X1:0
that they're off 18,
now southbound--

111
00:09:43,731 --> 00:09:46,316 X1:0
( tires screech )

112
00:09:47,567 --> 00:09:48,859
Old French Road
is closed down there

113
00:09:49,026 --> 00:09:50,736
so they're gonna head
back onto 18.

114
00:09:52,488 --> 00:09:54,323
( guns cock )

115
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,077
Sounds like they chasing those idiots
up and down every back road we've got.

116
00:09:58,243 --> 00:09:59,870
Maybe we'll get on one of them
video shows, you know?

117
00:10:00,037 --> 00:10:01,955
Like "World's Craziest Police Chases."
What do you think?

118
00:10:02,122 --> 00:10:03,916
What I think, Leon,
is you need to stay focused,

119
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:06,376
make sure you've got a round
in the chamber and your safety off.

120
00:10:06,543 --> 00:10:08,545
( distant sirens )

121
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:16,345 X1:0
Would be kinda cool,
getting on one of them shows.

122
00:10:20,098 --> 00:10:22,600
- ( engine revving )
- ( sirens blaring )

123
00:10:31,234 --> 00:10:33,736
- ( crashes )
- ( tires screech )

124
00:10:59,387 --> 00:11:01,389
( engine putters )

125
00:11:03,891 --> 00:11:05,518
Holy shit.

126
00:11:13,609 --> 00:11:15,111
( car door opens )

127
00:11:27,957 --> 00:11:29,792
- Gun gun gun!
- Put it down!

128
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:31,961
Man:
Put the gun down!

129
00:11:38,009 --> 00:11:39,635
Ah!

130
00:11:54,066 --> 00:11:56,651
( grunts, wheezes )

131
00:12:04,951 --> 00:12:06,369
Shane: Rick!

132
00:12:06,536 --> 00:12:08,538
I'm all right!
( wheezing )

133
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:13,709
I saw you get tagged, man.

134
00:12:13,876 --> 00:12:15,252
That scared the hell out of me.

135
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:17,295
Me too.

136
00:12:17,462 --> 00:12:19,464
That son of a bitch shot me.

137
00:12:19,631 --> 00:12:22,050
- You believe that?
- What? It catch you in your vest?

138
00:12:22,217 --> 00:12:23,801
Yeah.

139
00:12:25,887 --> 00:12:28,890
Shane, you do not tell Lori
that happened-- ever.

140
00:12:29,057 --> 00:12:31,642
- You understand? Ah!
- ( gunshot )

141
00:12:32,893 --> 00:12:35,729
- Man: Police, move in!
- Shane: No no no no no no no.

142
00:12:35,896 --> 00:12:38,357
- Man #2: You see where he come from?
- Shh shh shh shh.

143
00:12:38,523 --> 00:12:40,399
No no no no
no no no no.

144
00:12:40,566 --> 00:12:41,901
He's hit!

145
00:12:42,068 --> 00:12:44,779
Leon! You get
that ambulance down here!

146
00:12:44,946 --> 00:12:46,906
You tell them there's
an officer down! You do it now!

147
00:12:47,073 --> 00:12:48,407
Okay, shh shh shh shh.

148
00:12:48,574 --> 00:12:49,909
I'm here. Hey, you look at me.
You stay with me.

149
00:12:50,076 --> 00:12:51,994
You hear me?
Shh shh shh. Okay.

150
00:12:52,161 --> 00:12:53,829
I'm right here, Rick.
Stay with me. You hear me?

151
00:12:53,996 --> 00:12:56,332
Shh shh. That's it. Do you hear me?
Shh shh shh. Okay.

152
00:12:56,499 --> 00:12:58,584
I'm right here with you.
Stay with me.

153
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,627
- ( distant sirens )
- Shh shh. That's it. I'm right here.

154
00:13:00,794 --> 00:13:02,586
Leon over radio:
Dispatch, we have an officer down.

155
00:13:02,753 --> 00:13:04,380
Request paramedics,
please respond.

156
00:13:04,546 --> 00:13:06,382
Route 18 two miles west of I-85.

157
00:13:06,548 --> 00:13:08,676
Repeat, officer down.
Request immediate response.

158
00:13:08,842 --> 00:13:11,845
- ( ventilator hissing )
- ( heart monitor beeping )

159
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:15,766
( labored breathing )

160
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:17,768
( distorted )
Hey, bud.

161
00:13:18,978 --> 00:13:20,562
We're still here.

162
00:13:20,729 --> 00:13:23,274
We're still hanging in.

163
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:28,445
I'm sorry, man.

164
00:13:28,612 --> 00:13:31,115
I know I say the same crap
every time I come in here.

165
00:13:31,282 --> 00:13:33,284
( sighs )

166
00:13:35,286 --> 00:13:37,078
Everybody pitched in on these.

167
00:13:37,245 --> 00:13:39,497
They-- they wanted me
to bring ‘em down.

168
00:13:39,664 --> 00:13:41,374
They send their love,
and they just--

169
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,960
they hope you come back real soon.

170
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:49,172
( chuckles )
Linda and Diane from dispatch,

171
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:50,674
they picked these out.

172
00:13:50,841 --> 00:13:53,010
Probably could tell, huh?

173
00:13:55,803 --> 00:13:58,055
I'm just gonna set these
on your side table, okay?

174
00:14:02,893 --> 00:14:04,895
( silence )

175
00:14:07,732 --> 00:14:10,484
That vase--
that's something special.

176
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:14,155
‘Fess up. You steal that for me
at Grandma Jean's house?

177
00:14:14,322 --> 00:14:15,489
( laughing )

178
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:17,950
I hope you left her
that spoon collection.

179
00:14:20,661 --> 00:14:22,663
( coughing )

180
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,877
Shane?

181
00:14:31,505 --> 00:14:33,841
( rasps )
Shane, you in the john?

182
00:14:50,191 --> 00:14:52,193
( crackling )

183
00:15:20,346 --> 00:15:22,348
( grunting )

184
00:15:51,836 --> 00:15:53,671
Nurse, help.

185
00:15:55,423 --> 00:15:58,175
Nurse, help.

186
00:16:15,901 --> 00:16:18,278
( lights humming )

187
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:56,274
( phone clicks, clatters )

188
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,461
( electrical humming )

189
00:18:00,296 --> 00:18:02,298
( chain clinking )

190
00:18:10,139 --> 00:18:12,141
( door rattling )

191
00:18:30,493 --> 00:18:32,829
( thumping, moaning )

192
00:18:32,996 --> 00:18:34,998
( glass shatters )

193
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:40,169
( groaning )

194
00:19:01,482 --> 00:19:03,651
( groaning louder )

195
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,002
( Rick coughs )

196
00:19:29,552 --> 00:19:31,554
( coughing )

197
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:41,272
Ah!

198
00:20:02,752 --> 00:20:03,960
Ah.

199
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,099
Ah.

200
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,271
( clangs )

201
00:20:23,438 --> 00:20:25,440
( bugs chittering )

202
00:20:53,927 --> 00:20:55,929
( flies buzzing )

203
00:22:42,911 --> 00:22:44,913
- ( birds chirping )
- ( bugs chittering )

204
00:23:07,561 --> 00:23:09,563
( hissing )

205
00:23:10,814 --> 00:23:12,858
Ah. Ah. Oh shit.

206
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:16,528
( growling )

207
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:48,643
Lori.

208
00:23:51,855 --> 00:23:53,189
Lori!

209
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:03,366
Carl. Carl!

210
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:07,495
Shoot.

211
00:24:09,371 --> 00:24:11,748
Lori! Carl!

212
00:24:17,921 --> 00:24:19,923
( sobbing )

213
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:29,599
Lori! Carl.

214
00:24:45,782 --> 00:24:47,574
Is this real?

215
00:24:47,741 --> 00:24:49,743
Am I here?

216
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:57,874
Wake-- wake up.

217
00:24:58,041 --> 00:25:00,043
( sniffles )

218
00:26:09,195 --> 00:26:10,655
( twig snaps )

219
00:26:12,741 --> 00:26:14,617
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Rick: Carl.

220
00:26:14,784 --> 00:26:17,912
Carl. I found you.

221
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:20,790
Daddy, I got the sumbitch!
I'm gonna smack him dead!

222
00:26:27,881 --> 00:26:30,341
He say something?
I thought I heard him say something.

223
00:26:30,508 --> 00:26:32,885
- He called me Carl.
- Son, you know they don't talk.

224
00:26:33,052 --> 00:26:35,888
Hey, mister,
what's that bandage for?

225
00:26:36,055 --> 00:26:38,724
W-- what?

226
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:41,060
What kind of wound?

227
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:44,063
You answer me, damn you.

228
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:46,189
What's your wound?

229
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:48,899
You tell me...

230
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:51,275
or I will kill you.

231
00:26:58,657 --> 00:27:00,659
( footsteps )

232
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:12,213
( rubber gloves snap )

233
00:27:14,965 --> 00:27:17,093
Man: You got
that bandage changed now.

234
00:27:17,259 --> 00:27:18,803
It was pretty rank.

235
00:27:18,969 --> 00:27:22,181
What was the wound?

236
00:27:22,348 --> 00:27:25,725
- Gunshot.
- Gunshot?

237
00:27:26,768 --> 00:27:28,686
What else? Anything?

238
00:27:28,853 --> 00:27:31,523
Gunshot ain't enough?

239
00:27:33,274 --> 00:27:35,193
Look, I ask and you answer.

240
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,862
That's common courtesy, right?

241
00:27:41,658 --> 00:27:44,536
( emphatically )
Did you get bit?

242
00:27:46,162 --> 00:27:47,956
- Bit?
- Bit, chewed,

243
00:27:48,123 --> 00:27:50,959
maybe scratched--
anything like that?

244
00:27:51,126 --> 00:27:53,128
No, I got shot.

245
00:27:54,379 --> 00:27:56,588
Just shot as far as I know.

246
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,469
Hey. Just let me.

247
00:28:05,638 --> 00:28:07,014
Feels cool enough.

248
00:28:07,181 --> 00:28:09,976
Fever would've killed you by now.

249
00:28:10,143 --> 00:28:12,270
I don't think I have one.

250
00:28:12,436 --> 00:28:14,272
Be hard to miss.

251
00:28:20,153 --> 00:28:23,030
Take a moment,
look how sharp it is.

252
00:28:23,197 --> 00:28:25,533
You try anything,

253
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,160
I will kill you with it.

254
00:28:27,326 --> 00:28:29,537
And don't you think I won't.

255
00:28:36,502 --> 00:28:37,878
( rope snaps )

256
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,255
( knife clicks )

257
00:28:40,422 --> 00:28:42,841
Man:
Come on out when you're able.

258
00:28:46,136 --> 00:28:47,679
Come on.

259
00:28:57,647 --> 00:28:59,649
( ladle scrapes )

260
00:29:18,043 --> 00:29:22,714
Rick: This place--
Fred and Cindy Drake's?

261
00:29:22,881 --> 00:29:24,841
Man:
Never met ‘em.

262
00:29:25,008 --> 00:29:27,677
I've been here.
This is their place.

263
00:29:27,844 --> 00:29:30,221
Man:
It was empty when we got here.

264
00:29:33,307 --> 00:29:36,435
Don't do that.
They'll see the light.

265
00:29:36,602 --> 00:29:39,063
There's more of them
out there than usual.

266
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:42,983
I never should've fired
that gun today.

267
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,778
Sound draws them.
Now they're all over the street.

268
00:29:45,945 --> 00:29:49,573
Stupid-- using a gun.

269
00:29:50,657 --> 00:29:52,533
But it all happened so fast,

270
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,244
I didn't think.

271
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:56,412
You shot that man today.

272
00:29:56,579 --> 00:29:58,998
- Man?
- Boy: It weren't no man.

273
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:00,917
What the hell was that
out of your mouth just now?

274
00:30:01,084 --> 00:30:03,293
It wasn't a man.

275
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,088
You shot him in the street
out front-- a man.

276
00:30:06,255 --> 00:30:09,091
Friend, you need glasses.
It was a walker.

277
00:30:09,258 --> 00:30:12,135
Come on. Sit down

278
00:30:12,302 --> 00:30:14,554
before you fall down.

279
00:30:15,597 --> 00:30:16,848
Here.

280
00:30:19,935 --> 00:30:21,645
Daddy,

281
00:30:21,812 --> 00:30:23,480
blessing.

282
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:26,775
Yeah.

283
00:30:38,704 --> 00:30:41,123
Lord, we thank Thee for this food,

284
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:43,333
Thy blessings.

285
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,586
And we ask You to watch over us
in these crazy days.

286
00:30:46,753 --> 00:30:48,171
- Amen.
- Boy: Amen.

287
00:30:55,137 --> 00:30:57,222
Hey, mister, you even know
what's going on?

288
00:30:57,389 --> 00:31:01,560
I woke up today in the hospital,

289
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:05,480
came home
and that's all I know.

290
00:31:08,275 --> 00:31:10,527
But you know about
the dead people, right?

291
00:31:10,694 --> 00:31:12,988
Yeah, I saw a lot of that--

292
00:31:13,155 --> 00:31:15,657
out on the loading dock,
piled in trucks.

293
00:31:15,824 --> 00:31:18,327
No, not the ones they put down.

294
00:31:18,493 --> 00:31:20,870
The ones they didn't--
the walkers,

295
00:31:21,037 --> 00:31:23,830
like the one I shot today.

296
00:31:23,997 --> 00:31:25,540
‘Cause he'd have ripped into you,

297
00:31:25,707 --> 00:31:28,168
tried to eat you,
taken some flesh at least.

298
00:31:28,335 --> 00:31:31,671
Well, I guess if this is
the first you're hearing it,

299
00:31:31,838 --> 00:31:34,507
I know how it must sound.

300
00:31:37,135 --> 00:31:39,137
They're out there now?
In the street?

301
00:31:39,304 --> 00:31:40,388
Yeah.

302
00:31:40,555 --> 00:31:43,140
They get more active
after dark sometimes.

303
00:31:43,307 --> 00:31:45,142
Maybe it's the cool air or--

304
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:48,228
hell, maybe it's just
me firing that gun today.

305
00:31:48,395 --> 00:31:51,440
But we'll be fine
as long as we stay quiet.

306
00:31:51,607 --> 00:31:53,901
Probably wander off by morning.

307
00:31:56,028 --> 00:31:57,528
But listen,

308
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,865
one thing I do know--

309
00:32:01,032 --> 00:32:02,950
don't you get bit.

310
00:32:03,117 --> 00:32:06,120
I saw your bandage
and that's what we were afraid of.

311
00:32:06,287 --> 00:32:08,748
Bites kill you.

312
00:32:08,915 --> 00:32:10,707
The fever burns you out.

313
00:32:10,874 --> 00:32:12,584
But then after a while...

314
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,088
you come back.

315
00:32:21,385 --> 00:32:23,512
Seen it happen.

316
00:32:28,767 --> 00:32:30,769
Come on.

317
00:32:34,356 --> 00:32:36,358
( crickets chirping )

318
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:41,738
Man:
Carl-- he your son?

319
00:32:42,781 --> 00:32:46,118
Well, you--
you said his name today.

320
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:49,121
He's a little younger

321
00:32:49,287 --> 00:32:51,081
than your boy.

322
00:32:51,248 --> 00:32:52,874
Man:
And he's with his mother?

323
00:32:54,834 --> 00:32:56,460
I hope so.

324
00:32:56,627 --> 00:32:58,211
Boy: Dad.

325
00:32:59,254 --> 00:33:01,256
Hey.

326
00:33:01,423 --> 00:33:03,133
Did you ask him?

327
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:05,051
( chuckles )

328
00:33:05,218 --> 00:33:07,220
Man:
Your gunshot--

329
00:33:07,387 --> 00:33:09,013
we've got a little bet going.

330
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:12,100
My boy says
you're a bank robber.

331
00:33:12,267 --> 00:33:13,643
( chuckles )

332
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:16,354
Yeah, that's me,

333
00:33:16,521 --> 00:33:18,606
the deadliest Dillinger. Kapow.

334
00:33:18,773 --> 00:33:22,110
- ( man chuckles )
- Sheriff's deputy.

335
00:33:23,111 --> 00:33:24,946
Uh-huh.

336
00:33:26,865 --> 00:33:28,073
( car alarm blaring )

337
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,992
Hey, it's okay. Daddy's here.

338
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:31,910
It's nothing.

339
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:34,955
One of them must've
bumped a car.

340
00:33:35,122 --> 00:33:38,125
- Are you sure?
- It happened once before.

341
00:33:38,292 --> 00:33:41,295
It went on for a few minutes.

342
00:33:43,422 --> 00:33:44,965
Get the light, Duane.

343
00:33:45,132 --> 00:33:47,134
( alarm continues )

344
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,064
It's the blue one on the street,

345
00:34:01,231 --> 00:34:03,191
the same one as last time.

346
00:34:03,357 --> 00:34:05,485
I think we're okay.

347
00:34:08,029 --> 00:34:11,699
That noise--
won't it bring more of them?

348
00:34:11,866 --> 00:34:14,659
Man:
Nothing we can do about it now.

349
00:34:14,826 --> 00:34:17,120
Just have to
wait ‘em out till morning.

350
00:34:20,415 --> 00:34:22,542
( gasps )
She's here.

351
00:34:22,709 --> 00:34:26,086
Man: Don't look.
Get away from the windows.

352
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:29,840
I said go. Go on.

353
00:34:33,511 --> 00:34:37,056
- ( sobbing )
- Duane. Duane, quiet now.

354
00:34:37,223 --> 00:34:39,183
Come on. Quiet now.

355
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:42,853
Shh shh.

356
00:35:01,497 --> 00:35:03,791
It's okay. Here.

357
00:35:03,958 --> 00:35:06,543
Cry into the pillow.
Do you remember?

358
00:35:06,709 --> 00:35:08,836
Shh. Shh.

359
00:35:09,003 --> 00:35:11,673
( footsteps )

360
00:35:28,565 --> 00:35:30,275
( doorknob rattling )

361
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:49,085
She, um--

362
00:35:50,336 --> 00:35:51,838
she died in that other room

363
00:35:52,005 --> 00:35:53,631
on that bed in there.

364
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:58,886
There was nothing I--
I could do about it.

365
00:35:59,053 --> 00:36:01,347
That fever, man,

366
00:36:01,514 --> 00:36:05,059
her skin gave off
a heat like a furnace.

367
00:36:05,226 --> 00:36:07,228
( crying )

368
00:36:10,397 --> 00:36:11,773
I should've--

369
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,276
I should've put her down, man.
I should've put her down.

370
00:36:14,443 --> 00:36:15,986
I know that, but I--

371
00:36:17,946 --> 00:36:20,949
you know what?
I just didn't have it in me.

372
00:36:25,662 --> 00:36:27,748
She's the mother of my child.

373
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,752
( rattling continues )

374
00:36:53,774 --> 00:36:55,650
Rick:
Are we sure they're dead?

375
00:36:55,816 --> 00:36:58,694
I have to ask
at least one more time.

376
00:36:58,861 --> 00:37:00,696
Man:
They dead,

377
00:37:00,863 --> 00:37:02,823
except for something in the brain.

378
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:05,159
That's why
it's got to be the head.

379
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:12,332
( hisses )

380
00:37:13,792 --> 00:37:15,794
( growling )

381
00:37:19,047 --> 00:37:21,508
( grunting )

382
00:37:30,016 --> 00:37:31,684
Man:
Y'all all right?

383
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:35,687
I need a moment.

384
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:42,985
They're alive--
my wife and son.

385
00:37:43,152 --> 00:37:44,987
At least they were
when they left.

386
00:37:45,154 --> 00:37:46,530
How can you know?

387
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:48,532
By the look of this place--

388
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:51,201
I found empty drawers
in the bedroom.

389
00:37:51,368 --> 00:37:52,703
They packed some clothes-- not a lot,

390
00:37:52,869 --> 00:37:54,871
but enough to travel.

391
00:37:55,038 --> 00:37:58,207
You know anybody could've broken in
here and stole them clothes, right?

392
00:37:58,374 --> 00:38:00,876
You see the framed photos
on the walls?

393
00:38:02,211 --> 00:38:03,503
Neither do I.

394
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,546
Some random thief take
those too, you think?

395
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,262
Our photo albums,
family pictures-- all gone.

396
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:18,350
Photo albums.
( laughs )

397
00:38:22,062 --> 00:38:25,607
My wife-- same thing.

398
00:38:25,774 --> 00:38:27,818
There I am
packing survival gear,

399
00:38:27,985 --> 00:38:30,404
she's grabbing photo alb...

400
00:38:35,033 --> 00:38:37,369
They're in Atlanta, I bet.

401
00:38:37,536 --> 00:38:39,705
That's right.

402
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:42,416
- Why there?
- Man: Refugee center.

403
00:38:42,583 --> 00:38:45,544
A huge one they said,
before the broadcast stopped.

404
00:38:45,711 --> 00:38:48,922
Military protection, food, shelter.

405
00:38:49,089 --> 00:38:50,965
They told people to go there,

406
00:38:51,132 --> 00:38:52,716
said it'd be safest.

407
00:38:52,883 --> 00:38:54,885
Duane:
Plus they got that disease place.

408
00:38:55,051 --> 00:38:56,845
The Center
for Disease Control

409
00:38:57,012 --> 00:38:59,973
said they were working out
how to solve this thing.

410
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,108
( lock clicks )

411
00:39:23,121 --> 00:39:25,123
- ( knob squeaks )
- ( pipes groan )

412
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:29,753
Gas lines have been down
for maybe a month.

413
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,464
The station's got
its own propane system.

414
00:39:35,049 --> 00:39:36,633
Pilot's still on.

415
00:39:39,636 --> 00:39:41,262
- Duane: Whoo-hoo!
- Man: Oh my Lord.

416
00:39:41,429 --> 00:39:43,473
- Hot water!
- Ah!

417
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,516
That feels good, right?

418
00:39:45,682 --> 00:39:47,058
- ( laughs )
- ♪ Bring it around, bring it ♪

419
00:39:47,225 --> 00:39:48,851
♪ Bring it, bring it,
bring it around, uh! ♪

420
00:39:49,018 --> 00:39:51,646
Yeah. I'm wet.
Take that. What?

421
00:39:51,813 --> 00:39:53,231
Whoo!

422
00:39:55,483 --> 00:39:58,860
Duane.
Dressing room back there.

423
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,988
What do you say, Duane?

424
00:40:02,155 --> 00:40:03,907
Thank you.

425
00:40:04,991 --> 00:40:06,326
Man:
Mm-hmm.

426
00:40:08,328 --> 00:40:10,872
Rick:
Atlanta sounds like a good deal.

427
00:40:11,956 --> 00:40:14,291
Safer anyway-- people.

428
00:40:14,458 --> 00:40:16,502
Man:
That's where we were headed.

429
00:40:16,669 --> 00:40:18,671
Things got crazy.

430
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:20,798
Man, you wouldn't
believe the panic.

431
00:40:20,965 --> 00:40:22,841
Streets weren't fit to be on.

432
00:40:23,007 --> 00:40:24,591
And then my--

433
00:40:26,134 --> 00:40:28,511
my wife couldn't travel--

434
00:40:28,678 --> 00:40:31,347
no, not with her hurt--
so we had to find a place to lay low.

435
00:40:31,514 --> 00:40:33,933
And then after she died,

436
00:40:36,853 --> 00:40:39,105
we just stayed hunkered down.

437
00:40:41,148 --> 00:40:43,401
I guess we just froze in place.

438
00:40:45,236 --> 00:40:47,196
Plan to move on?

439
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:52,785
Haven't worked up to it yet.

440
00:41:00,793 --> 00:41:02,753
A lot of it's gone missing.

441
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,298
Daddy, can I learn
to shoot?

442
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:08,049
- I'm old enough.
- Hell yes, you're gonna learn,

443
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:10,593
but we've got to do it carefully,
teach you to respect the weapon.

444
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,761
That's right. It's not a toy.

445
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,555
You pull the trigger,
you have to mean it.

446
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,222
Always remember that, Duane.

447
00:41:16,389 --> 00:41:17,557
Yes sir.

448
00:41:19,766 --> 00:41:23,395
Man:
Here. Load up.

449
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:31,027
You take that one.
Nothing fancy.

450
00:41:31,193 --> 00:41:33,195
The scope's accurate.

451
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,835
Conserve your ammo.

452
00:41:48,002 --> 00:41:49,629
It goes faster than you think,

453
00:41:49,795 --> 00:41:51,547
especially at target practice.

454
00:41:52,923 --> 00:41:54,841
- Man: Duane.
- Uh-huh?

455
00:41:55,008 --> 00:41:56,592
- Take this to the car.
- Okay.

456
00:41:56,759 --> 00:41:58,761
Are you sure
you won't come along?

457
00:42:00,095 --> 00:42:03,056
A few more days.
By then Duane will know how to shoot

458
00:42:03,222 --> 00:42:04,890
and I won't be so rusty.

459
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:11,146
( walkie-talkie clicks, whines )

460
00:42:11,313 --> 00:42:13,941
You've got one battery.

461
00:42:14,107 --> 00:42:16,443
I'll turn mine on a few minutes
every day at dawn.

462
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,904
You get up there,
that's how you'll find me.

463
00:42:19,071 --> 00:42:22,240
- You think ahead.
- Can't afford not to,

464
00:42:22,407 --> 00:42:24,910
- not anymore.
- Man: Listen, one thing--

465
00:42:25,077 --> 00:42:27,788
they may not seem
like much one at a time,

466
00:42:27,955 --> 00:42:29,873
but in a group,
all riled up and hungry--

467
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,960
- man, you watch your ass.
- You too.

468
00:42:35,629 --> 00:42:38,757
You're a good man, Rick.
I hope you find your wife and son.

469
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:43,134
Be seeing you, Duane.

470
00:42:43,301 --> 00:42:45,345
- Take care of your old man.
- Yes sir.

471
00:42:45,512 --> 00:42:47,514
( zombie growling )

472
00:42:56,648 --> 00:42:58,817
Leon Basset?

473
00:43:02,654 --> 00:43:04,154
I didn't think much of him--

474
00:43:04,321 --> 00:43:06,657
careless and dumb-- but...

475
00:43:07,992 --> 00:43:09,743
I can't leave him like this.

476
00:43:10,953 --> 00:43:12,621
( growls )

477
00:43:12,788 --> 00:43:14,498
You know they'll hear the shot.

478
00:43:14,665 --> 00:43:17,001
Let's not be here
when they show up.

479
00:43:17,167 --> 00:43:19,628
Let's go, son. Come on.

480
00:43:22,005 --> 00:43:24,841
( car doors open )

481
00:43:25,008 --> 00:43:27,635
( doors close )

482
00:43:27,802 --> 00:43:30,096
( engine starts )

483
00:43:30,263 --> 00:43:32,055
( gun cocks )

484
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:52,325
( honks )

485
00:43:52,492 --> 00:43:54,202

486

487

( engine stops )

488
00:44:52,135 --> 00:44:54,262
Read your comic books awhile.

489
00:44:54,429 --> 00:44:56,139
Daddy'll be upstairs.

490
00:46:24,853 --> 00:46:26,855
( groaning )

491
00:46:45,665 --> 00:46:47,000
( whistles )

492
00:46:50,503 --> 00:46:52,047
( gunshot )

493
00:46:58,053 --> 00:47:00,347
- Daddy?
- It's all right, Duane!

494
00:47:00,513 --> 00:47:03,433
You stay there, son.
Don't you come up here.

495
00:47:05,685 --> 00:47:07,687
( crying )

496
00:47:09,022 --> 00:47:11,024
( mumbling )

497
00:47:23,745 --> 00:47:25,247

498
00:47:29,918 --> 00:47:31,502
Jenny.

499
00:47:32,878 --> 00:47:34,588
Come on, baby.

500
00:47:38,842 --> 00:47:40,844

501
00:47:57,069 --> 00:47:59,071
( growling )

502
00:48:05,286 --> 00:48:07,454
I'm sorry this happened to you.

Come on. Come on.

506
00:49:09,807 --> 00:49:11,391
Come on.

507
00:49:11,558 --> 00:49:13,060
Yeah.

508
00:49:28,367 --> 00:49:30,369

( radio crackling )

534
00:51:14,342 --> 00:51:16,470
He's gone.

535
00:51:18,138 --> 00:51:20,223
There are others.
It's not just us.

536
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:21,850
We knew there would be, right?

537
00:51:22,017 --> 00:51:23,351
That's why we left the CB on.

538
00:51:23,518 --> 00:51:25,020
A lot of good it's been doing.

539
00:51:25,187 --> 00:51:26,897
- Okay.
- Woman: And I've been saying for a week

540
00:51:27,063 --> 00:51:30,066
we ought to put signs up on 85
and warn people away from the city.

541
00:51:30,233 --> 00:51:32,193
Folks got no idea
what they're getting into.

542
00:51:32,359 --> 00:51:34,445
Well, we haven't had time.

543
00:51:35,821 --> 00:51:37,823
I think we need to make time.

544
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:41,743
Yeah, that--
that's a luxury we can't afford.

545
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:44,329
We are surviving here.
We are day to day.

546
00:51:45,497 --> 00:51:47,499
And who the hell would
you propose we send?

547
00:51:47,665 --> 00:51:49,333
I'll go. Give me a vehicle.

548
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,502
Nobody goes anywhere alone.
You know that.

549
00:51:57,007 --> 00:51:58,550
Yes sir.

550
00:51:58,717 --> 00:52:00,427
Hey hey hey.
Go on, take a seat, bud.

551
00:52:00,594 --> 00:52:02,429
You're all right.
Go on. You're all right.

552
00:52:05,849 --> 00:52:07,559
What, are you pissed at me?

553
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:12,856
You can be pissed at me all you want.
It's not gonna change anything.

554
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,692
I'm not putting you
in danger, okay?

555
00:52:16,859 --> 00:52:18,486
I'm not doing it for anything.

556
00:52:18,653 --> 00:52:20,529
That make you feel like
sometimes you want

557
00:52:20,695 --> 00:52:22,571
to slap me upside the head--
tell you what, girl:

558
00:52:22,738 --> 00:52:25,907
you feel that need, you go right ahead.
I'm right here. Go on.

559
00:52:27,867 --> 00:52:30,703
You cannot walk off like that,

560
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:32,789
all half-cocked.

561
00:52:32,956 --> 00:52:35,959
Look, you do not want to do it
for my sake or your sake, that's fine.

562
00:52:36,125 --> 00:52:39,254
But just-- you do it for him.

563
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:41,965
That boy has been
through too much

564
00:52:42,131 --> 00:52:44,926
and he's not losing
his mother too, okay?

565
00:52:46,052 --> 00:52:47,554
Okay?

566
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,556
I'm a good mom.

567
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:54,894
You tell me "okay."

568
00:52:59,566 --> 00:53:01,818
Hmm?
( chuckles )

569
00:53:01,985 --> 00:53:03,736
It's not hard.

570
00:53:03,903 --> 00:53:07,448
All right? Hey.

571
00:53:21,629 --> 00:53:23,256
Boy: Mom?

572
00:53:26,884 --> 00:53:29,345
Shane: What's up, bud?
She's in there. Go on.

573
00:53:31,097 --> 00:53:33,850
Hey, I don't want you to worry.

574
00:53:34,017 --> 00:53:36,436
Your mama's not
going anywhere, okay?

575
00:53:36,603 --> 00:53:39,063
Yeah? Yeah?

576
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:41,190
- Go finish your chores. Okay.
- Okay.

577
00:53:54,954 --> 00:53:56,956
( trunk clicks )

578
00:54:24,692 --> 00:54:26,319
Hello?

579
00:54:27,654 --> 00:54:30,156
Police officer out here.

580
00:54:31,991 --> 00:54:34,118
Can I borrow some gas?

581
00:54:36,663 --> 00:54:39,165
( wind chime tinkling )

582
00:54:42,918 --> 00:54:44,336
Hello?

583
00:54:48,215 --> 00:54:51,008
( knocks )
Hello?

584
00:54:51,175 --> 00:54:53,427
Anybody home?

585
00:55:11,028 --> 00:55:13,030
( flies buzzing )

586
00:55:53,446 --> 00:55:54,946
( spits )

587
00:56:25,602 --> 00:56:27,604
( horse nickers )

588
00:56:39,282 --> 00:56:41,785
- ( neighs )
- Easy now. Easy.

589
00:56:41,951 --> 00:56:43,286
I'm not gonna hurt you.

590
00:56:43,453 --> 00:56:45,789
Nothing like that.

591
00:56:47,207 --> 00:56:49,626
More like a proposal.

592
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,712
Atlanta's just down
the road a ways.

593
00:56:52,879 --> 00:56:56,424
It's safe there--
food, shelter, people.

594
00:56:56,591 --> 00:56:58,676
Other horses too, I bet.

595
00:57:00,845 --> 00:57:02,805
How's that sound?

596
00:57:02,971 --> 00:57:05,140
( softly )
There we go. Good boy.

597
00:57:05,307 --> 00:57:08,268
Good boy. Good boy.

598
00:57:08,435 --> 00:57:10,687
Now come with me. Come on.

599
00:57:10,854 --> 00:57:12,730
Come on. Come on.

600
00:57:12,897 --> 00:57:14,315
Come on.

601
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:17,485
Good boy.

602
00:57:22,323 --> 00:57:23,825
Just go easy, okay?

603
00:57:23,991 --> 00:57:26,536
I haven't done this for years.

604
00:57:27,703 --> 00:57:30,498
- Whoa. Whoa whoa whoa!
- ( neighs )

605
00:57:30,665 --> 00:57:32,917
Easy now.

606
00:57:33,084 --> 00:57:35,669
Easy, boy.
Easy. Easy.

607
00:57:35,836 --> 00:57:39,172
Easy. Easy. Eas--
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

608
00:57:39,339 --> 00:57:41,508
Whoa whoa whoa.

609
00:57:54,603 --> 00:57:56,355
Let's go.

610
00:57:58,691 --> 00:58:00,693
( birds cawing )

611
00:58:21,505 --> 00:58:23,882
( bugs chittering )

612
00:58:44,861 --> 00:58:46,863
( whinnies )

613
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,242
( growling )

614
00:59:35,161 --> 00:59:37,455
- ( whinnies )
- Whoa.

615
00:59:43,127 --> 00:59:45,296
- ( horse whinnies )
- Rick: Steady.

616
00:59:45,463 --> 00:59:48,048
There's just a few.
Nothing we can't outrun.

617
00:59:57,307 --> 00:59:59,684
Okay. Whoa whoa whoa.

618
01:00:01,644 --> 01:00:02,936
Whoa.

619
01:00:09,067 --> 01:00:11,069
- ( nickers )
- ( birds cawing )

620
01:00:33,049 --> 01:00:35,051
( helicopter approaching )

621
01:00:50,984 --> 01:00:53,486
- Hyah!
- ( neighs )

622
01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:01,619
( zombies groaning )

623
01:01:01,786 --> 01:01:04,706
( whinnying )

624
01:01:04,873 --> 01:01:06,875
( growling )

625
01:01:28,354 --> 01:01:31,066
Oh shit.

626
01:01:38,198 --> 01:01:39,574
Oh God.

627
01:01:49,793 --> 01:01:51,544
Oh God. Oh God.

628
01:01:58,551 --> 01:02:00,135
Shoot.

629
01:02:14,108 --> 01:02:15,900
Oh God. Oh God.

630
01:02:38,965 --> 01:02:41,634
Lori, Carl, I'm sorry.

631
01:02:49,851 --> 01:02:51,853
( panting )

632
01:02:53,813 --> 01:02:55,815
Oh... God.

633
01:03:06,826 --> 01:03:08,828
( growling )

634
01:03:11,497 --> 01:03:13,373
- ( gunshot echoes )
- ( high-pitched ringing )

635
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:15,292
Ah.

636
01:03:17,252 --> 01:03:19,254
Ah.

637
01:03:26,845 --> 01:03:28,345
Oh God.

638
01:03:45,654 --> 01:03:47,656
( muffled growling )

639
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:56,040
( ringing fading )

640
01:04:15,976 --> 01:04:17,978
( pounding )

641
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:37,581
( pounding )

642
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:01,272
( radio crackling )

643
01:05:05,818 --> 01:05:07,820
Man over radio:
Hey, you.

644
01:05:09,404 --> 01:05:11,280
Dumbass.

645
01:05:12,823 --> 01:05:14,115
Yeah, you in the tank.

646
01:05:14,282 --> 01:05:16,909
